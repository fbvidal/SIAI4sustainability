As governments of developing countries continue to shift to more advanced digital platforms, they have adopted practices and policies that have a direct impact on the future of AI-based technology. This research aims to discuss factors that may have a direct impact on the AI preparedness of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries. It evaluates a recent ranking developed by the international development research center (IDRC) focused on indicators towards the development or use of AI technology in governance, infrastructure, technological skills, and public services against each country's economic metrics including unemployment rate, gross domestic product per capita purchasing power parity (GDP-PPP), cost to hire an AI researcher, and countrywide education levels. It also reviews metrics and factors outside of economics which have a direct impact on AI readiness and its effects on each country's citizens, including automation potential and data privacy policies. This research discusses current issues with existing evaluation criteria for AI readiness and expands factors and considerations essential to LAC countries as they embrace the AI revolution.

The integration of automation and artificial intelligence into the logistics sector A Caribbean perspective	WORLDWIDE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM THEMES			English	Article						Caribbean; Logistics; Automation; Artificial intelligence; Shipping; Blue economy		Purpose Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are technologies that make a global impact by optimizing manual and time-intensive processes using data analytics and robotics, thus making the task more efficient, effective and less time-consuming. This is represented in the cyber-physical context, in which humans and technologies are allowed to coexist and learn from each other. Design/methodology/approach The logistics and supply chain sector consists of numerous partners and stakeholders, and despite the limited inclusion of automation and AI within the sector, there are still many manual and repetitive tasks. Findings Stakeholders in the logistics and supply chain sector are creating awareness and slowly implementing AI and automation within their operations. The majority of shipping and logistics is done through the maritime sector, and this is expected to increase in line with the world's population. Originality/value The purpose of this paper is to examine statistical data on the understanding of automation and AI within education, the port authority and major operators in the shipping and logistics sector throughout the Caribbean.

To assess the region's ability to manage water resources, we conducted an unprecedented literature review of over 20 000 multilingual research articles using machine learning and an understanding of the socio-hydrologic landscape. Results reveal that the region's vulnerability to water-related stresses, and drivers such as climate change, is compounded by research blind spots in niche topics (reservoirs and risk assessment) and subregions (Caribbean nations), as well as by its reliance on an individual country (Brazil). A regional bright spot, Brazil, produces well-rounded water-related research, but its regional dominance suggests that funding cuts there would impede scientifically informed water management in the entire region.

First it analyzes the effects of the exponential acceleration within the realm of data processing that lead to the optimization of various human activities, to then consider how the incorporation of such technologies will necessarily entail a new approach to achieve the proper transition toward a system compatible with human rights. In this respect, it is emphasized that development asymmetries are often followed by the need to protect and guarantee the effectiveness of rights, which will require that technological advances be oriented towards inclusive innovations, through an optimized interface system and attentive to the modern form of digital interactions. However, as well as promoting the development of the positive type of artificial intelligence, it also embodies the concern about the lack of conceptual traceability of such systems. Necessarily concluding the inclusion of pre-established guiding principles must be required within the structure of such systems to guarantee their correct use and application.

Nowadays, there are different management systems, for instance: quality, environmental, information security, etc. that can be applied over education centers, but to implement all of them is not a guarantee of education quality because the educational process is very complex. However, a few years ago the Quality Management Systems for higher education centers are taking importance especially in Europe and North America, although in Latin America is an unexplored field. Higher education centers quality is a very complex problem because it is difficult to measure the quality since there are a lot of academic processes as enrollment, matriculation, teaching-learning with a lot of stakeholders as students, teachers, authorities even society; in a lot of locations as campuses, buildings, laboratories with different resources. Each process generates a lot of records and documentation. This information has a varied nature and it is present at a structured and no-structured form. In this context, artificial intelligence techniques can help us to analyze and management knowledge. Our work presents a new approach to audit academic information with machine learning and information retrieval. In our experiments, we used information about syllabus, grades, assessments and online content from a Latin American University. We conclude that using artificial intelligence techniques minimize the decision support time, it allows full data analysis instead of a data sample and it finds out patterns never seen in the case study university.

Ideally, health inferences would instead be made on a pre-death timescale that would enable, for instance, environmental mitigation that could promote coral resilience. To this end, diverse Caribbean coral (Orbicella faveolata) genotypes of varying resilience to high temperatures along the Florida Reef Tract were exposed herein to elevated temperatures in the laboratory, and a proteomic analysis was taken with a subset of 20 samples via iTRAQ labeling followed by nano-liquid chromatography + mass spectrometry; 46 host coral and 40 Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellate proteins passed all stringent quality control criteria, and the partial proteomes of biopsies of (1) healthy controls, (2) sub-lethally stressed samples, and (3) actively bleaching corals differed significantly from one another. The proteomic data were then used to train predictive models of coral colony bleaching susceptibility, and both generalized regression and machine-learning-based neural networks were capable of accurately forecasting the bleaching susceptibility of coral samples based on their protein signatures. Successful future testing of the predictive power of these models in situ could establish the capacity to proactively monitor coral health.

This is a field that generates results that amplify and extend to political communication, such as microsegmentation or automated diffusion of content; likewise, it produces some adverse effects that hinder citizen participation in the cybersphere. This paper presents a review of works published in three Latin American countries (Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico) with artificial intelligence, communication, and democracy as their constituent elements. The data come from a total of 206 documents, including reports from supranational organisms and associations, and publications in scientific journals indexed in databases such as Google Scholar and Scopus between 2011 and 2021. The selection criterion is based on the total or partial appearance of certain keywords, plus filters by relevance and impact factors. This systematic review is structured based along four axes that explain democracy according to Landman et al. (2009): electoral participation, participation of civil society, media integrity, and impartial administration. The main conclusions indicate that many of the practices in the studied countries are still at an incipient or experimental stage, with algorithmic political communication being used especially during electoral campaigns. Similarly, an increasing resistance from civil society to the influence of social networks is starting to be detected.

However, difficulties are still encountered by managers in adequately assessing sustainability at the corporate level. In this perspective, data mining and machine learning are presented as techniques for extracting potentially useful information for generation of knowledge. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to identify, by means of a literature review, different approaches used to assist in the evaluation of sustainable performance. The method called Methodi Ordinatio was used for the review and, for the analysis, the software tools: VOSviewer e RStudio. By means of the methodological procedure adopted, 33 significant articles were identified for analysis from the Web of Science, Scopus and Science Direct databases, in which mainly the applied techniques were addressed. In this sense, this study seeks to stimulate research on the use of DM and ML to help in the sustainable context, being essential to assist in the Sustainable Development Goals.

Comparative Coastal Risk Index (CCRI): A multidisciplinary risk index for Latin America and the Caribbean	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EXTREME WAVE CLIMATE; VULNERABILITY; CLASSIFICATION; VARIABILITY; MITIGATION; FRAMEWORK; FLOOD	As the world's population grows to a projected 11.2 billion by 2100, the number of people living in low-lying areas exposed to coastal hazards is projected to increase. Critical infrastructure and valuable assets continue to be placed in vulnerable areas, and in recent years, millions of people have been displaced by natural hazards. Impacts from coastal hazards depend on the number of people, value of assets, and presence of critical resources in harm's way. Risks related to natural hazards are determined by a complex interaction between physical hazards, the vulnerability of a society or social-ecological system and its exposure to such hazards. Moreover, these risks are amplified by challenging socioeconomic dynamics, including poorly planned urban development, income inequality, and poverty. This study employs a combination of machine learning clustering techniques (Self Organizing Maps and K-Means) and a spatial index, to assess coastal risks in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) on a comparative scale. The proposed method meets multiple objectives, including the identification of hotspots and key drivers of coastal risk, and the ability to process large-volume multidimensional and multivariate datasets, effectively reducing sixteen variables related to coastal hazards, geographic exposure, and socioeconomic vulnerability, into a single index. Our results demonstrate that in LAC, more than 500,000 people live in areas where coastal hazards, exposure (of people, assets and ecosystems) and poverty converge, creating the ideal conditions for a perfect storm. Hotspot locations of coastal risk, identified by the proposed Comparative Coastal Risk Index (CCRI), contain more than 300,00 people and include: El Oro, Ecuador; Sinaloa, Mexico; Usulutan, El Salvador; and Chiapas, Mexico. Our results provide important insights into potential adaptation alternatives that could reduce the impacts of future hazards. Effective adaptation options must not only focus on developing coastal defenses, but also on improving practices and policies related to urban development, agricultural land use, and conservation, as well as ameliorating socioeconomic conditions.

Such models can be valuable tools to understand the biogeography of species and to support the prediction of its presence/absence considering a particular environment scenario. This paper investigates the use of different supervised machine learning techniques to model the potential distribution of 35 plant species from Latin America. Each technique was able to extract a different representation of the relations between the environmental conditions and the distribution profile of the species. The experimental results highlight the good performance of random trees classifiers, indicating this particular technique as a promising candidate for modelling species' potential distribution.

Impact of COVID-19 on electricity demand of Latin America and the Caribbean countries	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS			English	Article						Demand consumption; COVID-19 pandemic; Lockdown; Regression analysis; Clustering; Classification trees	ENERGY	Governments worldwide have adopted different public health measures in order to slow down the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the electricity demand has been impacted by the changes in human activity. Many of the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries have adopted different approaches to control the COVID-19 pandemic, including severe shutdown of most social and economic activities. This paper analyzes how this pandemic has influenced, from its appearance until the fall of 2020, the demand of ten LAC countries (Peru, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay). The approach is based on the concepts of size and shape impacts, which have been proposed in order to decompose the problem for a better understanding of the impact. The size impact accounts for the observed variations on the daily demand, whereas the shape impact focuses on the variations observed on the standardized hourly demand profiles for each day. To calculate both impacts, the observed demand is compared to the expected one if the COVID-19 crisis had not happened. To obtain reliable estimations in the scenario without COVID19, machine learning techniques have been used. Peru and Bolivia are the two countries where the pandemic has had the greatest impact during 2020, with a size impact in April 2020 of around -30%. At the opposite extreme would be Chile and Uruguay, with a maximum monthly size impact of -6%. The other considered countries have maximum monthly impacts in the range of -11% to -17%.

J	Gallardo, M				Gallardo, Mauricio			<p>Measuring vulnerability to multidimensional poverty with Bayesian network classifiers</p>	ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY			English	Article						Poverty; Vulnerability; Bayesian networks; Bayesian classifiers; Latin America; Chile; Downside risk; Social risk	STOCHASTIC-DOMINANCE; MEAN-SEMIDEVIATION	Bayesian network methods have recently gained great popularity in machine learning literature and applications to model uncertainty in complex phenomena that include relationships between multiple random variables. However, these models are not commonly applied in economics and development studies. Here, we introduce the Bayesian network classifier models to estimate the probability of a person to be welfare deprived in one and multiple dimensions. These probabilities are then used for measuring vulnerability to multidimensional poverty (VMP) in four alternative measurement frameworks. Currently, two of them can be found in the literature, but have been estimated with Probit and Logit models, which are unidimensional strategies. Instead of that, in this study, we follow a multidimensional strategy to solve an estimation problem that is multidimensional in nature. Two new VMP measurement procedures based on Bayesian network classifiers estimates are also introduced in this article. We illustrate the four estimation procedures using the household survey and the census data from Chile 2017. A 5-fold cross-validation exercise verifies a high predictive performance of these Bayesian network classifier models, with the highest accuracy being that of one of the new measurements that we put forward. Our findings reveal that the Bayesian network classifier models offer an adequate alternative to face the policy challenge of measuring vulnerability to multidimensional poverty.

This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based preoperative score to predict cardiac surgical operative mortality. METHODS We developed various models to predict cardiac operative mortality using machine learning techniques and compared each model to European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation-II (EuroSCORE-II) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves (ROC AUC and PR AUC) as performance metrics. The model calibration in our population was also reported with all models and in high-risk groups for gradient boosting and EuroSCORE-II. This study is a retrospective cohort based on a prospectively collected database from July 2008 to April 2018 from a single cardiac surgical center in Bogota, Colombia. RESULTS Model comparison consisted of hold-out validation: 80% of the data were used for model training, and the remaining 20% of the data were used to test each model and EuroSCORE-II. Operative mortality was 6.45% in the entire database and 6.59% in the test set. The performance metrics for the best machine learning model, gradient boosting (ROC: 0.755; PR: 0.292), were higher than those of EuroSCORE-II (ROC: 0.716, PR: 0.179), with a P value of .318 for the AUC of the ROC and .137 for the AUC of the PR. CONCLUSIONS The gradient boosting model was more precise than EuroSCORE-II in predicting mortality in our population based on ROC and PR analyses, although the difference was not statistically significant.

Smart Farm Mechanization for Sustainable Indian Agriculture	AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA			English	Article						Agricultural Mechanization; Artificial Intelligence; Digital Agriculture; Mobile App; Precision Agriculture		Indian agriculture is undergoing transformation due to technological revolution, sprawling urbanization, modern cultivation techniques, and climate change. These changes offer unique challenges and opportunities to transform agriculture to smart, more productive, economically remunerative, socially equitable and environmentally sustainable through adoption of smart mechanization technologies. In this paper, the approaches and strategies are highlighted for sustainable mechanization of Indian agriculture. The smart farm mechanization includes application of sensors, controllers, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The research work in the areas of precision agriculture, digital farming, precision irrigation, AI powered machinery, user friendly mobile applications, etc. has gained momentum in India during the last decade. The emerging smart agriculture mechanization combines precision farm with management tools (GPS/GNSS, DSS, VRT), end user ap- plications (platforms, mobile, machines, Agri-bots), data solutions (data IoT, information, tech empowered tools), etc. These technologies not only make farm machinery smart and efficient but also help in saving inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, water and energy for sustainable agriculture.

The need to establish more inclusive and sustainable public transport programs has brought larger cities in Latin America to seek new ways to enhance mobility and integration of transport systems. In this paper, we analyze the level of mobility and integration of public transport systems in eight Latin American cities. For each city we applied the mobility integration index introduced by Cohen [1] and Kamargianni [2] considering key factors including ticket and payment integration, use of information and communication technologies (ICT), institutional integration, clean energy transport and mobility packages. The study indicates that Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City and Buenos Aires have made most advances in implementing a more integrated and mobile public transport system, with Sao Paulo, Santiago de Chile and Curitiba showing an intermediate level of integration and Lima and Bogota struggling to achieve higher levels of mobility. While the study indicates that integrated mobility programs are taking off in Latin America, faster development is limited by multiple factors including a lacking vision on inclusive and sustainable public transport, resistance from transport operators, limitations in ICT infrastructure and limited financial resources to embark on mayor mobility programs in the region. Given that this research is limited to a comparison of Latin American cities and to advance with much needed mobility in the region, it is recommended to conduct further research and derive lessons learned from smart cities with more advanced levels of mobility in public transport in Europe or Asia.

Design/methodology/approach A documental analysis was performed to select HEIs and Brazilian regional development indicators. Then, the assessment of the sustainable and institutional performance of Brazilian municipalities that have HEIs consisted of three parts: clustering with an unsupervised machine learning model, ranking with a hybrid multi-criteria decision making method and visualization of sustainability performance with the dashboard. Findings The critical analysis of institutional and sustainability indicators contributes to a more active role of HEIs in matters of social responsibility, with a more holistic view of the performance and quality of municipal education. Furthermore, this critical analysis creates a scenario where HEIs can develop public policy proposals in partnership with the government to mitigate the main issues identified. Social implications With this study, HEIs will be able to direct their actions to minimize the deficits found in the municipalities, consolidating their social responsibility. Originality/value This study proposes a new decision-support tool with a dashboard of indicators so that HEIs can foster research projects with a focus on regional SD.

MLtool: A Tool to Automate the Construction, Evaluation, and Selection of Machine Learning Models	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Machine Learning; Model Selection; Automatic Algorithm Selection; Automated Machine Learning	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY	The use of Machine Learning has intensified in recent years, gaining notoriety in the most diverse applications. Thus, there is a growing demand for professionals in this area, which has favored the entry of countless inexperienced users in the labor market. The path from the initial step to the use of algorithms and Machine Learning techniques in production environment takes considerable time, even from experts, due to the realization of interactive and manual tasks required for building predictive models that provide the desired results. In view of this, this work presents a tool to automate the construction, evaluation and selection of predictive models considering Machine Learning algorithms and parameters values more appropriate for each situation. The stages of feature selection, standardization, resampling, and training in the construction of models were considered in the tool. The proposed tool deal with the treatment of the problem of data unbalancing, as needed, as well as the execution control of the steps involved in the process of creating predictive models. The results obtained demonstrate that the order and choice of the steps and the values chosen for the algorithm parameters affect the final results of the generated models.

Localization System For Autonomous Mobile Robots Using Machine Learning Methods And Omnidirectional Sonar	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Mobile Robotics; Localization; Omnidirectional Sonar; Machine Learning		In the past few years, the mobile robotics has presented a growth in the research field, due to its high application area. The robot localization and its displacement in an unknown environment are fundamental to its operation. Furthemore, signal processing techniques and machine learning methods have been widely appled along with sensors into mobile robot mapping, localization and navigation. In this paper, a low cost and efficient approach for mobile robot localization using sensing by omnidirectional sonar along with signal processing techniques and machine learning methods is proposed. Regarding to classifiers, Bayes classifier, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), k-Nearest Neighbors kNN, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Optimum Path Forest (OPF) were analyzed. According to results, OPF using Canberra distance was the best method with accuracy of 98.13 percent and test time of 17.4us.	[Almeida, J. S.; Marinho, L. B.; Assis, E. A.; Reboucas Filho, P.

However, the holistic and complicated nature of the goals has made their attainment difficult. Achieving all goals by 2030 given countries' limited budgets with the economic and social disruption that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused is over-optimistic. To have the most profound impact on the SDGs achievement, prioritising and improving co-beneficial goals is an effective solution. This study confirms that countries' geographic location and income level have a significant relationship with overall SDGs achievement. This article applies the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm to identify the top five SDGs that drive the overall SDG score. The results show that the influential SDGs vary for countries with a specific income level located in different regions. In Europe and Central Asia, SDG10 is among the most influential goals for high-income countries, SDG9 for upper-middle-income, SDG3 in low and lower-middle-income countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, and SDG5 in Latin America and the Caribbean upper-middle-income countries. This systematic and exploratory data-driven study generates new insights that confirm the uniqueness, and non-linearity of the relationship between goals and overall SDGs achievement.

This connective life also presents new challenges, such as surveillance capitalism, the attention economy, and contingent intellects, formed by powerful persuasive algorithms. In this context, the 147th edition of Chasqui is proposed as an Ibero-American transnational digital culture observatory. To do this, we have selected 10 articles that reveal significant networks, and in which user behaviors are studied; Ibero-American habits, uses and customs are mapped on social networks; Forms of organization in the consumption, production and circulation of content are described; techniques and content used to manipulate information and opinion are analyzed; describe and identify themselves in ways of spreading false news and hate speech; and new theoretical proposals are presented to understand Latin America through the analysis and reading of fields such as big data, machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, algorithms, or data analysis and visualization systems.

With increasing uncertainty in healthcare, existing unmet needs such as poor outcomes of lung cancer (LC) patients in LMICs, mainly due to late stages at diagnosis, have been challenging-necessitating a shift in focus for judicious health resource utilization. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for screening large volumes of pulmonary images performed for noncancerous reasons, such as health checks, immigration, tuberculosis screening, or other lung conditions, including but not limited to COVID-19, can facilitate easy and early identification of incidental pulmonary nodules (IPNs), which otherwise could have been missed. AI can review every chest X-ray or computed tomography scan through a trained pair of eyes, thus strengthening the infrastructure and enhancing capabilities of manpower for interpreting images in LMICs for streamlining accurate and early identification of IPNs. AI can be a catalyst for driving LC screening with enhanced efficiency, particularly in primary care settings, for timely referral and adequate management of coincidental IPN. AI can facilitate shift in the stage of LC diagnosis for improving survival, thus fostering optimal health-resource utilization and sustainable healthcare systems resilient to crisis. This article highlights the challenges for organized LC screening in LMICs and describes unique opportunities for leveraging AI. We present pilot initiatives from Asia, Latin America, and Russia illustratingAl-supported IPN identification from routine imaging to facilitate early diagnosis of LC at a potentially curable stage.

Assessment of the Sustainability of Agroecosystems in the Amazon Region Using Neural Artificial Networks	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Agroforestry systems; sustainability; artificial neural networks		The assessment of sustainability provides the actual situation of a site and provides information for decision making. In the Amazon, the assessment of the sustainability benefits of using adapted analytical models. However, this model is not always accurate. In this paper we propose a methodology that uses an artificial intelligence algorithm based on artificial neural networks (ANN), as a decision support tool, which aims to classify agroecosystems with agroforestry systems and without agroforestry systems. The sites are classified into two groups: Sustainable and Not Sustainable. For data collection we carried out technical visits to the rural community of Santa Luzia, in the municipality of Tome-Acu, Para Amazon. During the research data of 28 production units were collected. Finally, the data were submitted to the ANN and the results demonstrate the high potential of using computational intelligence algorithms for the purpose of monitoring the agro forestry systems in the Amazon region.

However, after excluding data collected under non-optimal observing conditions such as strong sun glint, clouds, thick aerosols, straylight, and large viewing angles, only similar to 5% of MODIS ocean measurements lead to valid Chl retrievals, regardless of the fact that about 25-30% of the global ocean is cloud free. A recently developed ocean color index (CI) is effective in deriving relative ocean color patterns under most non-optimal observing conditions to improve coverage, but these patterns cannot be interpreted as Chl. In this study, we combine the advantage of the high-quality, low-coverage Chl and lower-quality, higher-coverage CI to improve spatial and temporal coverage of Chl through machine learning, specifically via a random forest based regression ensemble (RFRE) approach. For every MODIS scene, the machine learning requires CI, Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc (lambda = 469, 555, 645 nm), dimensionless), and high-quality low-coverage Chl from the common pixels where they all have valid data to develop an RFRE-based model to convert CI and R-rc (lambda) to Chl. The model is then applied to all valid CI pixels of the same scene to derive Chl. This process is repeated for each scene, and the model parameterization is optimized for each scene independently. The approach has been tested for the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (YSECS) where non-optima) observing conditions frequently occur. Validations using extensive field measurements and image-based statistics for 2017 show very promising results, where coverage in the new Chl maps is increased by similar to 3.5 times without noticeable degradation in quality as compared with the original Chl data products. The improvement in Chl coverage without compromising data quality is not only critical in revealing otherwise unknown bloom patterns, but also important in reducing uncertainties in time series analysis. Tests of the RFRE approach for several other regions such as the East Caribbean, Arabian Sea, and Gulf of Mexico suggest its general applicability in improving Chl coverage of other regions.

This work focuses on analyzing the social opinion of the inhabitants of Popayan (Colombia), about the architectural heritage of the historical center. The surveys were designed by an interdisciplinary team of architects, environmentalists, chemists, historians, mathematics, engineering, ... that work on Artificial Intelligence applied to the preventive conservation of heritage buildings, and were revised by a sociologist. The results were analyzed as a tool to determine the factors involved in the degree of weakness that historical buildings suffer and estimate the vulnerability and hazards, facing different threats.

In this paper, drawing on the structural power of business, we examine the rule-setting power in which sugarcane ethanol companies engage, and then discuss why these companies develop and use institutions to promote sustainability. We use a machine learning algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation, to identify companies' commitment to sustainability and business-led governance by analyzing a large volume of data from public corporate documents. The results reveal 36 main themes that demonstrate the rule-setting power of the sugarcane ethanol industry through voluntary standards, codes of conduct, and corporate social responsibility these companies use as indicators of superior social and environmental performance and to show sustainability is embedded in companies' priorities. However, the results also show critical issues of unsustainable production practices can affect industry image and stress socio-environmental relationships. These issues can be ameliorated with integrative governance that considers the independence of the sectors involved in ethanol production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Real time dynamic vulnerability assessment (DVA) has to be done in order to decide and coordinate the appropriate corrective control actions, depending on the event evolution. This paper presents a novel approach for carrying out real time DVA, focused on Transient Stability Assessment (TSA), based on some time series data mining techniques (Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis MSSA, and Principal Component Analysis PCA), and a machine learning tool (Support Vector Machine Classifier SVM-C). In addition, a general overview of the state of the art of the methods to perform vulnerability assessment, with emphasis in the potential use of PMUs for post-contingency DVA, is described. The developed methodology is tested in the IEEE 39 bus New England test system, where the simulated cause of vulnerability is transient instability. The results show that time series data mining tools are useful to find hidden patterns in electric signals, and SVM-C can use those patterns for effectively classifying the system vulnerability status.

More and more approaches have been developed on top of DL models, also due to the unprecedented amount of software-related data that can be used to train these models. One of the recent applications of DL in the software engineering domain concerns the automatic detection of software vulnerabilities. While several DL models have been developed to approach this problem, there is still limited empirical evidence concerning their actual effectiveness especially when compared with shallow machine learning techniques. In this paper, we partially fill this gap by presenting a large-scale empirical study using three vulnerability datasets and five different source code representations (i.e., the format in which the code is provided to the classifiers to assess whether it is vulnerable or not) to compare the effectiveness of two widely used DL-based models and of one shallow machine learning model in (i) classifying code functions as vulnerable or non-vulnerable (i.e., binary classification), and (ii) classifying code functions based on the specific type of vulnerability they contain (or "clean", if no vulnerability is there). As a baseline we include in our study the AutoML utility provided by the Google Cloud Platform. Our results show that the experimented models are still far from ensuring reliable vulnerability detection, and that a shallow learning classifier represents a competitive baseline for the newest DL-based models.

Modeling Workplace Evacuation Behaviors Using Intelligent Agents	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Artificial Intelligence; Computational Modeling; LCS; Autonomous Agents		A major challenge in artificial intelligence has been the development of autonomous agents (AAs) capable of displaying believable behaviors. To achieve such objective, the underlying architectures of these intelligent systems have been designed to incorporate Learning Classifier System that provides an adaptation naturally with the environment. It is expected that through the interaction of this type of components, AAs can implement more intelligent and believable behavior. Although the literature reports several computational models of behaviors, attention, and emotions developed to be included in cognitive agent architectures, these have been implemented as separated processes, disregarding essential interactions between these behaviors whose modeling and computational implementation may increase the believability of actions developed by AAs. In this paper, we propose an evolutive computational model. This model is designed to provide AAs with adequate mechanisms to attend and react to conditions and changes in the environment.	[Ramos, M.

In a world driven by a new wave of technological change, the platform would revalue the role of think tanks, research institutions and knowledge hubs to move the global agenda in an issue of central importance for the future of society: the creation of the jobs of the future. Building on and complementing existing experiences, the T20 platform would be a digital hub for producing knowledge, informing policies and connecting potential partners to accelerate the jobs of the future, within the context of an increasing integrated global economy. It would also contribute to the development of consensual views among the research community, allowing to discard extreme visions about the jobs of the future, dispelling both overly optimistic visions with no evidence base and unwarranted fears.

With the increase in the share of solar photovoltaic systems, the impact of power fluctuations in these sources has worsened, which can affect the quality of electrical energy and the reliability of the electrical power system. Therefore, with the use of energy storage together with control algorithms based on artificial intelligence, it is possible to control and perform power smoothing. In this context, the study presents a technical feasibility study on the use of artificial neural network (ANN) to perform the power smoothing of the photovoltaic system connected to the network. Being studied the performance of a real photovoltaic system operating in conjunction with an ideal energy storage for comparative analysis of the performance of the artificial neural network when the numbers of neurons and layers are modified for different real operating conditions considered as temperature variation, humidity, irradiation, pressure and wind speed, which are considered to be ANN input data. The results obtained point to the feasibility of using ANN, with acceptable precision, for power smoothing. According to the analyzes carried out, it is clear that ANN's with few neurons, the smoothing profile tends to be more accurate when compared to larger amounts of neurons. In the current state of the study, it was not possible to determine a relationship between the variations in the number of neurons with the most accurate results, it is important to note that the development of the curve pointed by the neural network can be influenced by the database. It should be noted that, when ANN exceeds or does not reach the optimal smoothing curve, the storage system compensates for the lack or excess of power, and there is a need for other mechanisms to optimize power smoothing.

This study aimed to develop a prognostic score for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients with AKI (AKI-COV score). This was a cross-sectional multicentre prospective cohort study in the Latin America AKI COVID-19 Registry. A total of 870 COVID-19 patients with AKI defined according to the KDIGO were included between 1 May 2020 and 31 December 2020. We evaluated four categories of predictor variables that were available at the time of the diagnosis of AKI: (1) demographic data; (2) comorbidities and conditions at admission; (3) laboratory exams within 24 h; and (4) characteristics and causes of AKI. We used a machine learning approach to fit models in the training set using tenfold cross-validation and validated the accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The coefficients of the best model (Elastic Net) were used to build the predictive AKI-COV score. The AKI-COV score had an AUC-ROC of 0.823 (95% CI 0.761-0.885) in the validation cohort. The use of the AKI-COV score may assist healthcare workers in identifying hospitalized COVID-19 patients with AKI that may require more intensive monitoring and can be used for resource allocation.

In 2019, Latin America took the main stage in a wave of protests. While the social side of protests is widely explored, the focus of this study is the evolution of gaseous urban air pollutants during and after one of these events. Changes in concentrations of NO2, CO, O-3 and SO2 during and after the strike, were studied in Quito, Ecuador using two approaches: (i) inter-period observational analysis; and (ii) machine learning (ML) gradient boosting machine (GBM) developed business-as-usual (BAU) comparison to the observations. During the strike, both methods showed a large reduction in the concentrations of NO2 (31.5-32.36%) and CO (15.55-19.85%) and a slight reduction for O-3 and SO2. The GBM approach showed an exclusive potential, especially for a lengthier period of predictions, to estimate strike impact on air quality even after the strike was over. This advocates for the use of machine learning techniques to estimate an extended effect of changes in human activities on urban gaseous pollution.

However, AP is less understood from a spatial perspective. The aim of this study was to investigate a methodology using a machine learning approach to determine which answers from a questionnaire-based survey were relevant for explaining the high AP of secondary school students across urban-rural gradients in Ecuador. We used high school locations to construct individual datasets and stratify them according to the AP scores. Using the Boruta algorithm and backward elimination, we identified the best predictors, classified them using random forest, and mapped the AP classification probabilities. We summarized these results as frequent answers observed for each natural region in Ecuador and used their probability outputs to formulate hypotheses with respect to the urban-rural gradient derived from annual maps of impervious surfaces. Our approach resulted in a cartographic analysis of AP probabilities with overall accuracies around 0.83-0.84% and Kappa values of 0.65-0.67%. High AP was primarily related to answers regarding the academic environment and cognitive skills. These identified answers varied depending on the region, which allowed for different interpretations of the driving factors of AP in Ecuador. A rural-to-urban transition ranging 8-17 years was found to be the timespan correlated with achievement of high AP.

We present the details of underwater data acquisition, processing and curation to create this large dataset of coral reef imagery annotated for habitat mapping. A diver-operated hyperspectral imaging system (HyperDiver) was used to survey 147 transects at 8 coral reef sites around the Caribbean island of Curacao. The underwater proximal sensing approach produced fine-scale images of the seafloor, with more than 2.2 billion points of detailed optical spectra. Of these, more than 10 million data points have been annotated for habitat descriptors or taxonomic identity with a total of 47 class labels up to genus- and species-levels. In addition to HyperDiver survey data, we also include images and annotations from traditional (color photo) quadrat surveys conducted along 23 of the 147 transects, which enables comparative reef description between two types of reef survey methods.

The risk assessment determines the likelihood of something going wrong in a distribution network through the failure probability metric. To deal with the massive variety of information required in the calculation of failure probability we propose a data mining approach. The proposed approach incorporates weather, asset and outage information for characterizing the risk in a distribution network section via GIS platform.

Students' Attention Monitoring System in Learning Environments based on Artificial Intelligence	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Monitoring; Manuals; COVID-19; Multitasking; IEEE transactions; Deep learning; Computational modeling; Early warning system; Learning environment; LSTM; Monitoring; Students' attention	RECOGNITION	The students' attention level to the explanation of a given lecture is a factor that might determine the capability of retention and subsequent application of a learned concept. For this reason, students that pay attention are generally more participatory in the learning/teaching process than those who don't, and consequently, they succeed in reaching the competencies proposed in the courses. Hence, it is important to design strategies and tools that help teachers to monitor in a non-invasive way the attention level of the students, allowing them to take actions to modify the dynamics of the lectures when needed. In this work, we introduce a fully automated system to monitor the students' attention based on computer vision algorithms. To this end, we feed a recurrent neural network with one-second sequences generated by facial landmarks. This spatiotemporal analysis of video recordings allows for identifying when a student is attending a given explanation in online educational environments. The system is tested in a database with more than 3000 sequences of students who pay or no attention to online video lectures. Obtained results show that the proposed system is suitable to monitor the students' attention to a particular explanation.

Analysis of incidence of air quality on human health: a case study on the relationship between pollutant concentrations and respiratory diseases in Kennedy, Bogota	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Geostatistics; Machine learning; Sustainable development; Air quality; Hot spots	PM2.5 CONCENTRATIONS; REGRESSION; POPULATION; PROXIMITY; ASTHMA; IMPACT; MODEL; PM10	Thousands of deaths associated with air pollution each year could be prevented by forecasting the behavior of factors that pose risks to people's health and their geographical distribution. Proximity to pollution sources, degree of urbanization, and population density are some of the factors whose spatial distribution enables the identification of possible influence on the presence of respiratory diseases (RD). Currently, Bogota is among the cities with the poorest air quality in Latin America. Specifically, the locality of Kennedy is one of the zones in the city with the highest recorded concentration levels of local pollutants over the last 10 years. From 2009 to 2016, there were 8619 deaths associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in the locality. Given these characteristics, this study set out to identify and analyze the areas in which the primary socioeconomic and environmental conditions contribute to the presence of symptoms associated with RD. To this end, information collected in field by performing georeferenced surveys was analyzed through geostatistical and machine learning tools which carried out cluster and pattern analyses. Random forests and AdaBoost were applied to establish hot spots where RD could occur, given the conjugation of predictor variables in the micro-territory. It was found that random forests outperformed AdaBoost with 0.63 AUC. In particular, this study's approach applies to densely populated municipalities with high levels of air pollution. In using these tools, municipalities can anticipate environmental health situations and reduce the cost of respiratory disease treatments.

In environments where several decisions have to be made, the MAS is conformed by agents that utilize artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to support real time autonomous operation. This paper presents a proposed application of MAS in electrical substation automation and in distribution automation systems. These automation systems are formed, among other equipment, by the Local Master Station (LMS): the computational system of the substation. The master station executes the control and central processing of the distribution networks or dispatch regional centers. In this kind of environments, multiple collaborative agents achieve their specific goals and cooperate to achieve the system goal. Specific activities carried out by the agents include the acquisition of information, communication transport information, data management and visualization functions. The acquisition is achieved from the substation equipment like remote terminal units (RTUs), meters, protections and relays (IEDs). This paper presents an overview of the principles underlying the intelligent agents' paradigm and the AI techniques that can be utilized to support collaborative agents in a substation environment. This paper also discusses the potential benefits of this approach over the traditional architectures as well as the foreseen challenges involved.	[Picasso-Blanquel, C.; Ibarguengoytia, P.

In soybean production, the country is the second largest producer with 114.0 million tons in the 2016/2017 harvest. Mato Grosso state is the largest Brazilian producer with 30.5 million tons and the port of Santos is mainly requested by being the largest port in Latin America. However, the poor infrastructure of the transport road causes bottlenecks when dispatching soybean through the major ports. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used worldwide in logistics; therefore, we propose to design, train and simulate an ANN on MatLab (c) software to forecast the demand of soybean produced in Mato Grosso and exported through the port of Santos. The value of 9.0 million tons was predicted for 2017 as an increase of about 26.5% compared with the 2016 movement of 7.1 million tons. In addition, it was noticed that 5.9 million tons were moved only in the first five months (Jan-May) of transactions in 2017.

Sean			Land cover and forest formation distributions for St. Kitts, Nevis, St. Eustatius, Grenada and Barbados from decision tree classification of cloud-cleared satellite imagery	CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE			English	Article						vegetation map; land-use change; Landsat; Caribbean; forest conservation; machine learning; multidate	THEMATIC MAPPER DATA; SUCCESSIONAL STAGE; REGRESSION TREES; BIODIVERSITY	Satellite image-based mapping of tropical forests is vital to conservation planning. Standard methods for automated image classification, however, limit classification detail in complex tropical landscapes. In this study, we test an approach to Landsat image interpretation on four islands of the Lesser Antilles, including Grenada and St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Eustatius, testing a more detailed classification than earlier work in the latter three islands. Secondly, we estimate the extents of land cover and protected forest by formation for five islands and ask how land cover has changed over the second half of the 20(th) century. The image interpretation approach combines image mosaics and ancillary geographic data, classifying the resulting set of raster data with decision tree software. Cloud-free image mosaics for one or two seasons were created by applying regression tree normalization to scene dates that could fill cloudy areas in a base scene. Such mosaics are also known as cloud-filled, cloud-minimized or cloud-cleared imagery, mosaics, or composites. The approach accurately distinguished several classes that more standard methods would confuse; the seamless mosaics aided reference data collection; and the multiseason imagery allowed us to separate drought deciduous forests and woodlands from semi-deciduous ones. Cultivated land areas declined 60 to 100 percent from about 1945 to 2000 on several islands. Meanwhile, forest cover has increased 50 to 950%. This trend will likely continue where sugar cane cultivation has dominated. Like the island of Puerto Rico, most higher-elevation forest formations are protected in formal or informal reserves. Also similarly, lowland forests, which are drier forest types on these islands, are not well represented in reserves. Former cultivated lands in lowland areas could provide lands for new reserves of drier forest types. The land-use history of these islands may provide insight for planners in countries currently considering lowland forest clearing for agriculture.

J	Macarayan, EK; Balabanova, D; Gotsadze, G				Macarayan, Erlyn K.; Balabanova, Dina; Gotsadze, George			Assessing the field of health policy and systems research using symposium abstract submissions and machine learning techniques	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Agenda setting; healthcare organizations; health systems research; health policy; international health policy; health inequalities; community		The field of health policy and systems research (HPSR) has grown rapidly in the past decade. Examining recently aggregated data from the Global Symposia on Health Systems Research, a key global fora for HPSR convened by the largest international society-Health Systems Global (HSG)-provides opportunities to enhance existing research on HPSR capacity using novel analytical techniques. This addresses the demand not only to map the field but also to examine potential predictors of acceptance to, and participation at, these global conferences to inform future work and strategies in promoting HPSR. We examined data from the abstracts submitted for two Global Symposia on Health Systems Research in 2016 and 2018 by type of institution, countries, regional groupings and gender. After mapping hotspot areas for HPSR production, we then examined how the corresponding authors characteristics were associated with being accepted to present at the Global Symposia. Our findings showed that submissions for the Global Symposia increased by 12% from 2016 to 2018. Submissions increased across all participant groups, in particular, the for-profit organizations and research/consultancy firms showing the highest increases, at 58% for both. We also found reduced submissions from high-income countries, whereas submissions from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, increased substantially revealing the inclusivity values of Symposium organizers. Submissions increased to a larger extent among women than men. Being a woman, coming from a high-income country and having multiple abstracts submitted were found to be significant predictors for an abstract to be accepted and presented in the Symposia. Findings provide critical baseline information on the extent of interest and engagement in a global forum of various institutions and researchers in HPSR that can be useful for setting future directions of HSG and other similar organizations to support the advancement of HPSR worldwide.

An approach based on linguistics features and word embeddings	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Misogyny detection; Text classification; Natural language processing; Machine-learning	CLASSIFICATION; SENTIMENT; SEXISM	Online social networks allow powerless people to gain enormous amounts of control over particular people's lives and profit from the anonymity or social distance that the Internet provides in order to harass other people. One of the most frequently targeted groups comprise women, as misogyny is, unfortunately, a reality in our society. However, although great efforts have recently been made to identify misogyny, it is still difficult to distinguish as it can sometimes be very subtle and deep, signifying that the use of statistical approaches is not sufficient. Moreover, as Spanish is spoken worldwide, context and cultural differences can complicate this identification. Our contribution to the detection of misogyny in Spanish is two-fold. On the one hand, we apply Sentiment Analysis and Social Computing technologies for detecting misogynous messages in Twitter. On the other, we have compiled the Spanish MisoCorpus-2020, a balanced corpus regarding misogyny in Spanish, and classified it into three subsets concerning (1) violence towards relevant women, (2) messages harassing women in Spanish from Spain and Spanish from Latin America, and (3) general traits related to misogyny. Our proposal combines a classification based on average word embeddings and linguistic features in order to understand which linguistic phenomena principally contribute to the identification of misogyny. We have evaluated our proposal with three machine-learning classifiers, achieving the best accuracy of 85.175%. Finally the proposed approach is also validated with existing corpora for misogyny and aggressiveness detection such as AMI and HatEval obtaining good results (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nita, SL; Mihailescu, MI; Pau, VC				Nita, Stefania Loredana; Mihailescu, Marius Iulian; Pau, Valentin Corneliu			Security and Cryptographic Challenges for Authentication Based on Biometrics Data	CRYPTOGRAPHY			English	Article						machine learning; chaos-based cryptography; Hadoop; data clustering; biometrics		Authentication systems based on biometrics characteristics and data represents one of the most important trend in the evolution of the society, e.g., Smart City, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big Data. In the near future, biometrics systems will be everywhere in the society, such as government, education, smart cities, banks etc. Due to its uniqueness, characteristic, biometrics systems will become more and more vulnerable, privacy being one of the most important challenges. The classic cryptographic primitives are not sufficient to assure a strong level of secureness for privacy. The current paper has several objectives. The main objective consists in creating a framework based on cryptographic modules which can be applied in systems with biometric authentication methods. The technologies used in creating the framework are: C#, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell. The wide range of technologies for developing the algorithms give the readers the possibility and not only, to choose the proper modules for their own research or business direction. The cryptographic modules contain algorithms based on machine learning and modern cryptographic algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption System), SHA-256, RC4, RC5, RC6, MARS, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), Elliptic Curve, and Diffie Hellman. As methods for implementing with success the cryptographic modules, we will propose a methodology which can be used as a how-to guide. The article will focus only on the first category, machine learning, and data clustering, algorithms with applicability in the cloud computing environment. For tests we have used a virtual machine (Virtual Box) with Apache Hadoop and a Biometric Analysis Tool. The weakness of the algorithms and methods implemented within the framework will be evaluated and presented in order for the reader to acknowledge the latest status of the security analysis and the vulnerabilities founded in the mentioned algorithms. Another important result of the authors consists in creating a scheme for biometric enrollment (in Results). The purpose of the scheme is to give a big overview on how to use it, step by step, in real life, and how to use the algorithms. In the end, as a conclusion, the current work paper gives a comprehensive background on the most important and challenging aspects on how to design and implement an authentication system based on biometrics characteristics.

Data was collected from multiple sources, including small-scale farmers. Machine learning algorithms combined with expert opinion defined how variation in weather, soils and management practices interact and affect maize yield of small-scale farmers. This knowledge was then used to provide guidelines on management practices likely to produce high, stable yields. The effectiveness of the practices was confirmed in on-farm trials. The principles established can be applied to rainfed crops produced by small-scale farmers to better manage their crops with less risk of failure.

The different data used for the design and evaluation of this method are obtained from Purace volcano of two surveillance volcanic areas: Geochemistry and Deformation. The proposed method learns quickly from data streams in real time and the different volcanic anomalies can be detected taking into account all the previous data of the volcano. RDE achieves good performance in the outliers detection; 82% of precision for geochemestry data, while 77% of precision in geodesy data.

Studies show that globally fish species of commercial importance and their reproduction sites are decreasing at an alarming rate. In Honduras there is little information on these reproduction sites, marine biology analysts have determined that it is of crucial importance to monitor these sites. Obtaining video recordings of the FSA's is vital to study and monitoring efforts, however it turns out to be very time consuming. This study proposes a neural network capable of the detection, classification, and counting of 11 fish species indicatives of reproductive activity at FSA. With this implementation it will be possible to dedicate more time to communication and socialization of the knowledge obtain to local authorities and fishermen, reduce personnel cost, and allow for the inclusion of innovative and technological solutions. Using the Incremental methodology, the Caribbean Fish database of 387 images is created for the training process of the neural network using YOLOv4 and Darknet as infrastructure and architecture respectively with an experimental approach. After 3 stages of training and testing, the object detector and classifier obtained a mAP of 88.1% and average retention of 80%. The network shows that is very capable of complying with the requirements of the monitoring process of fish reproduction sites through video recordings.

It also allows a better understanding of global climate regulation as a potential carbon sink or source. Large area assessments usually require data from spaceborne remote sensors, but most of them cannot measure the vertical variability of vegetation structure, which is required for accurately measuring fuel loads and defining management interventions. The recently launched NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) full-waveform lidar sensor holds potential to meet this demand. However, its capability for estimating fuel load has yet not been evaluated. In this study, we developed a novel framework and tested machine learning models for predicting multi-layer fuel load in the Brazilian tropical savanna (i.e., Cerrado biome) using GEDI data. First, lidar data were collected using an unnamed aerial vehicle (UAV). The flights were conducted over selected sample plots in distinct Cerrado vegetation formations (i.e., grassland, savanna, forest) where field measurements were conducted to determine the load of surface, herbaceous, shrubs and small trees, woody fuels and the total fuel load. Subsequently, GEDI-like full-waveforms were simulated from the high-density UAV-lidar 3-D point clouds from which vegetation structure metrics were calculated and correlated to field-derived fuel load components using Random Forest models. From these models, we generate fuel load maps for the entire Cerrado using all on-orbit available GEDI data. Overall, the models had better performance for woody fuels and total fuel loads (R-2 = 0.88 and 0.71, respectively). For components at the lower stratum, models had moderate to low performance (R-2 between 0.15 and 0.46) but still showed reliable results. The presented framework can be extended to other fire-prone regions where accurate measurements of fuel components are needed.

We aimed to carry out a quantitative assessment of the link between reef coral traits and species extinction risk informed by extinctions of reef corals observed in the fossil record. Location Global. Time period Plio-Pleistocene and present day. Major taxa studied Scleractinian reef corals. Methods We used morphological traits, phylogenetic information and evidence of extinction during the Plio-Pleistocene to predict the extinction risk of contemporary reef corals. Our model was trained using 138 Caribbean fossil coral species and an automatic machine learning algorithm. We then used this model to predict the extinction risk of 674 modern coral species. Results Model validation confirmed 77% accuracy in predicting extinction risk of fossil corals. Extinction risk predicted by our model showed a near-random (57%) match with the IUCN conservation status. Our model also suggested that corals in the Least Concern or Near Threatened categories might be at higher risk of extinction than currently believed. Main conclusions Morphological traits of fossil corals linked to their extinction risk in the Plio-Pleistocene Caribbean Sea are known to reflect the vulnerability of extant corals. However, the results from our fossil-calibrated model do not match the IUCN assessment of reef corals, with increased overall extinction risk. This does not necessarily indicate near-future extinction risk, because fossil extinctions are spread over thousands of years. However, we show the applicability of using fossil data to inform the extinction risk of modern corals and recommend that future assessments of extinction risk of reef corals should consider incorporating the relationship between morphological traits and resilience, calibrated by fossil data, to maximize the utility of the extinction risk assessment.

The relatively affluent in these countries circumvent the problem by installing grid-connected backup systems, which provide uninterrupted supply. However, these backup systems increase losses and burden the local electricity grid. For instance, estimates show that in Pakistan, between 2%- 3% of annual energy generation is lost through battery charging. In addition, due to these elite backup systems, over 10% of all distribution transformers are overloaded. This overload causes needless expenditure that developing countries can not afford, as well as greenhouse gas emissions which accelerate climate change. This paper investigates various data-driven optimal control strategies to improve backup systems' operational efficiency. Preliminary results show that by employing a smart controller, household energy consumption can be reduced by 3%- 7%, while grid overload costs can be reduced by almost a quarter. Furthermore, model-assisted reinforcement learning controller is able to approach the performance of data-driven model predictive control at a fraction of the computational cost while far outperforming model-free reinforcement learning algorithm.

However, the cumulative effect of small frequent fires can shape large landscapes, and fire-prone ecosystems are abundant in the tropics. Climate change has the potential to greatly expand fire-prone areas to moist and wet tropical forests and grasslands that have been traditionally less fire-prone, and to extend and create more temporal variability in fire seasons. We built a machine learning random forest classifier to analyze the relationship between climatic, socio-economic, and fire history data with fire occurrence and extent for the years 2003-2011 in Puerto Rico, nearly 35,000 fires. Using classifiers based on climate measurements alone, we found that the climate space is a reliable associate, if not a predictor, of fire occurrence and extent in this environment. We found a strong relationship between occurrence and a change from average weather conditions, and between extent and severity of weather conditions. The probability that the random forest classifiers will rank a positive example higher than a negative example is 0.8-0.89 in the classifiers for deciding if a fire occurs, and 0.64-0.69 in the classifiers for deciding if the fire is greater than 5 ha. Future climate projections of extreme seasons indicate increased potential for fire occurrence with larger extents.

Getting Its Feet on the Ground: Elucidating Paralouatta's Semi-Terrestriality Using the Virtual Morpho-Functional Toolbox	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						platyrrhine; semi-terrestriality; machine-learning; geometric morphometrics; finite element analysis; Paralouatta; talus	FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE; ANTILLOTHRIX-BERNENSIS; TELL US; PLATYRRHINE; EVOLUTION; MONKEY; EXTINCTION; MODELS; XENOTHRIX	Currently, there are no living platyrrhine primates inhabiting the main Caribbean islands. Nevertheless, the fossil record of this area has provided outstanding findings of different New World monkeys that were part of a diverse radiation exhibiting remarkably unusual morphologies. Among these, the Cuban genus Paralouatta corresponds to one of the most enigmatic primates ever found in the Greater Antilles. Some researchers have argued that Paralouatta's post-cranium shows evidence of semi-terrestriality, a locomotor adaptation that is unusual, if not unique, in platyrrhine evolutionary history. Whether or not Paralouatta was truly semi-terrestrial remains uncertain, however, due to a lack of more sophisticated functional analyses on its morphology. Using novel virtual morpho-functional techniques on a comparative sample of 3D talar models belonging to diverse primate species representing three substrate preferences, this study aims to further evaluate whether Paralouatta was a semi-terrestrial genus or not. Geometric morphometrics and finite element analysis were used to empirically assess shape and biomechanical performance, respectively, and then several machine-learning (ML) classification algorithms were trained using both morphometric and biomechanical data to elucidate the substrate preference of the fossils. The ML algorithms categorized the Paralouatta specimens as either arboreal or as species commonly active on both ground and in trees. These mixed results are suggestive of some level of semi-terrestriality, thus representing the only known example of this locomotor behavior in platyrrhine evolutionary history.

Coordination Scheme and Behavior Fusion Based on Fuzzy Weighting Factors for a Mobile Robotic Navigation	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						fuzzy control; behavior based fuzzy control architecture; mobile robotic; obstacle avoidance; tracking behavior; behavior coordination; artificial intelligence		This paper presents a behavior fuzzy coordination scheme for a mobile robot platform. The control architecture is composed of three basic behaviors: obstacle avoidance, left wall following and right wall following. The mechanism of fusion behavior was performed on a weighting system that acquires information from the environment and calculates fuzzy dynamic weighting factors adjusted to the region in which the robot travels. These factors influence the output of each behavior giving strength to the most appropriate action according to the current situation of the environment.

Identifying Roadway Surface Disruptions Based on Accelerometer Patterns	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						road surface disruptions; RSD; mobile computing; mobile sensing; machine learning algorithms		In developed countries large-scale technology is used for the monitoring and management of road infrastructure. Sensor networks together with surveillance cameras help identify elements disturbing cars' mobility. On the contrary, in developing countries, the lack of this level of infrastructure makes the task of roads' maintenance and traffic control challenging. The presence of roadway surface disruptions (RSDs), in particular, affects the economy and reputation of individuals and companies. Urban computing strategies can be adopted to collect data about the presence of RSDs and be applied to monitor traffic related issues. The implementation of such level of navigation assistance could help save freight and money to companies and authorities, and even reduce cars' accidents. In this direction, current mobile technologies can help with the identification and location of road imperfections alerting drivers about alternative routes. In this paper we present our work that seeks to enable citizens' cars as road watchers. By means of the mobile phones' acceleration sensing capabilities we are identifying and tagging the presence of RSDs. Using Android-based devices situated on the copilot floor side of a car, 5 Mbytes of road information has been collected. We run a series of experiments aiming to differentiate acceleration patterns associated to potholes, speed bumps, metal humps and rough roads. Currently, the classification of disruptions is being experimented with techniques from the field of Machine Learning (ML) such as artificial neuronal networks and logistic regression. Classification of individual events is over 86% of accuracy that is competitive with those reported in the literature. In this work we provide the first public dataset that could be used by other researchers to offer more insight in this problem.	[Gonzalez, L. C.; Martinez, F.; Carlos, M.

Dorado; Jimenez, Daniel; Gardeazabal, Andrea			Multiyear Maize Management Dataset collected in Chiapas, Mexico	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Explanatory machine learning; Sustainable intensification; Smallholders; Tropical agriculture		For several decades, maize (Zea mays L.) management decisions in smallholder farming in tropical regions have been a puzzle. To best balance alternative management practices' environmental and economic outcomes, an extensive dataset was gathered through CIMMYT's knowledge hub in Chiapas, a state in southern Mexico. In a knowledge hub, farmers, with the support of farm advisors, compare conventional and improved agronomic practices side-by-side and install demonstration fields where they implement improved practices. In all these fields data on on-farm operations and results is collected. The dataset was assembled using field variables (yield, cultivars, fertilization and tillage practice), as well as environment variables from soil mapping (slope, elevation, soil texture, pH and organic matter concentration) and gridded weather datasets (precipitation, temperature, radiation and evapotranspiration). The dataset contains observations from 4585 fields and comprises a period of 7 years between 2012 and 2018. This dataset will facilitate analytical approaches to represent spatial and temporal variability of alternative crop management decisions based on observational data and explain model-generated predictions for maize in Chiapas, Mexico. In addition, this data can serve as an example for similar efforts in Big Data in Agriculture. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

We verified whether clinical staff could distinguish between these two types of falls by comparing 3,078 free-text incident reports about falls using a natural language processing technique and a machine learning technique. Common terms were used in reports for both types of falls, but the similarity score between the two types of reports was low, and the performance of identification based on the classification model constructed by support vector machine and deep learning was low. Although it is possible that adjustment of hyper parameters during construction of the classification model was required, we believe that clinical staff cannot distinguish between the two types of falls and do not record the distinction in incident reports.

Automatic Cyberbullying Detection: a Mexican case in High School and Higher Education students	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Cyberbullying; Radio frequency; Blogs; Videos; IEEE transactions; Deep learning; Computational modeling; Bullying; Cyberbullying; Machine learning; Social networks; Deep learning		The social interaction among young students has been partially or totally transformed to mobile-based communication, specifically through the use of social networks. This new communication environment has allowed a more immediate, diverse and massive interaction, offering a faster and more effective situation when carrying out academic and recreational activities. However, this scenario has also promoted the phenomenon of social harassment known as bullying, exponentially increasing its scope and diversifying the types and forms of aggression. Machine learning and natural language processing techniques have been used to create models that detect bullying situations among students, using data corpus from mainly public social networks. However, generally, these data sources are not representative of the social networks commonly used by the students; generating classification models that do not consider the vocabulary used by this social group. This article describes the methodology used to create a representative data corpus of the interaction between Mexican high school and university students, and a comparative analysis on characteristics that influence the quality of the content of a corpus in this domain. In addition, the performance achieved by implementing various machine learning models to identify bullying situations is presented. The best result is reported for the Naive Bayesian classifier (F1-Score of 0.862), performing better than models based on deep learning such as Recurrent (F1-Score of 0.845) and Convolutional (F1-Score of 0.807) Neural Networks.

This is especially true for the continent's hyperarid, arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid zones, collectively known as drylands, which are under-represented ecosystems that are highly threatened by climate change and human activity. Maps of LULC in drylands are, thus, essential in order to investigate their vulnerability to both natural and anthropogenic impacts. This paper comprehensively reviewed existing mapping initiatives of South America's drylands to discuss the main knowledge gaps, as well as central methodological trends and challenges, for advancing our understanding of LULC dynamics in these fragile ecosystems. Our review centered on five essential aspects of remote-sensing-based LULC mapping: scale, datasets, classification techniques, number of classes (legends), and validation protocols. The results indicated that the Landsat sensor dataset was the most frequently used, followed by AVHRR and MODIS, and no studies used recently available high-resolution satellite sensors. Machine learning algorithms emerged as a broadly employed methodology for land cover classification in South America. Still, such advancement in classification methods did not yet reflect in the upsurge of detailed mapping of dryland vegetation types and functional groups. Among the 23 mapping initiatives, the number of LULC classes in their respective legends varied from 6 to 39, with 1 to 14 classes representing drylands. Validation protocols included fieldwork and automatic processes with sampling strategies ranging from solely random to stratified approaches. Finally, we discussed the opportunities and challenges for advancing research on desertification, climate change, fire mapping, and the resilience of dryland populations. By and large, multi-level studies for dryland vegetation mapping are still lacking.

The most relevant areas related to childhood development are the numbers, vision, emotional control, peer social skills, hearing, habitual ways of responding, symbols, and language. For this important reason, in this paper, we present an educational environment aimed at providing a set of tools to contribute to early stimulation of children assisting to low and middle-income schools. Our system relies on mobile apps and stuffed toy robots able to interact with children and other robots to teach several concepts related to early development in both, individual intervention sessions, and group sessions. This tool incorporates a rule-based reasoning expert system to select intervention strategies better. To validate our proposal, we worked with 47 children and a team of experts in the early education area.

The ICON program has pioneered the use of artificial intelligence techniques to assess near real-time data streams from environment sensor networks such as the SEAKEYS Network (Florida Keys), the Australia Institute of Marine Science Weather Network, NOAA's Coral Reef Ecosystem Division network in the Pacific, and its own Integrated Coral Observing Network (ICON) of stations in the Caribbean. Besides its innovative approach to coral monitoring station deployments, the ICON program recently pioneered techniques for the near real-time integration of satellite, in situ and radar data sources for purposes of ecological forecasting of such events as coral bleaching, coral spawning, upwelling and other marine behavioral or physical oceanographic events. The ICON program has also ushered in the use of Pulse-Amplitude-Modulating fluorometry to measure near real-time physiological recording of response to environmental stress during coral bleaching, thus providing even better ecological forecasting capabilities through artificial intelligence and data integrative techniques. Herewith, we describe these techniques, along with a report on new coral calcification instrumentation augmenting the ICON Network sensor array.

Including Conversational Agents into Structured Hybrid 3D Virtual Environments	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE Latin-America Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)	NOV 24-26, 2013	Santiago, CHILE	IEEE Commun Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers		3D Virtual Worlds; Human-Computer Interaction; AIML		Structured Hybrid 3D Virtual Environments are 3D virtual spaces where staff (organisational) software agents support human users in their task achievement. These systems are characterized by: i) being hybrid, so that humans and software agents can interact; and ii) being structured and task oriented, so that interactions are regulated by a subjacent Organisation Centered Multi Agent System (OCMAS) - an Electronic Institution (EI). The contribution of this paper is to include task-oriented conversational staff bots (i. e. the embodiment of staff agents in the 3D environment) that communicate with users by using natural language. With this aim, we extend the Artificial Intelligence Mark-up Language (AIML) with special tags to enable complex task-oriented conversations whose flow needs to consider both the states of the conversation and the ontology related to the task. We evaluate the usability of our conversational proposal and compare it to a previous command-based interaction system. Results show the conversational approach presents a higher user satisfaction than the command-based one. Moreover, in average, it also performs better in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and errors.	[Almajano, P.] Univ Barcelona, CSIC, IIIA, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Sanchez, M.

Expert System for the Validation of Academic Credits in Higher Education Institutions	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Artificial Intelligence; Java; Academic Credits Validation		The capability of an expert system to acquire performance similar to the human ones allows its application in various areas of knowledge. In higher education institutions one of the activities that require the knowledge of an expert and a considerable time, is the validation of academic credits analysis requested by students coming from other courses or institutions. In this context, this study aimed to develop an expert system to support the validation of academic credits in higher education institutions. For the system development were carried out activities of requirement elicitation, modeling and construction of SE knowledge base. For it's implementation were used the Java programming language by the integrated development environment NetBeans 7.2 and the database management system used was MySQL 5.5.27 server. The expert system developed has reached the goal proposed acting as an efficient tool for the specialist during the validation analysis of academic credits, featuring the average hit rate of 89.4%.

PV solar power generation has intrinsic characteristics related to the climatic variables that cause intermittence during the generation process, promoting instabilities and insecurity in the electrical system. One of the solutions for this problem uses methods for the Prediction of Solar Photovoltaic Power Generation (PSPPG). In this context, the aim of this study is to develop and compare the prediction accuracy of solar irradiance between Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long-Term Short Memory (LSTM) network models, from a comprehensive analysis that simultaneously considers two distinct sets of exogenous meteorological input variables and three short-term prediction horizons (1, 15 and 60 min), in a controlled experimental environment. The results indicate that there is a significant difference (p < 0.001) in the prediction accuracy between the ANN and LSTM models, with better overall prediction accuracy skill for the LSTM models (MAPE = 19.5%), except for the 60 min prediction horizon. Furthermore, the accuracy difference between the ANN and LSTM models decreased as the prediction horizon increased, and no significant influence was observed on the accuracy of the prediction with both sets of evaluated meteorological input variables.

An agent usually starts a conversation by querying another agent because it needs to satisfy a specific goal. This process allocates a new goal to the agent receiving the initial query, starting new dialogs with other agents, generating a recursive interaction. The generation of this kind of dialog is interesting when the system has the possibility of generating conditional answers with imprecise and uncertain values. We consider simple deliberative rule-based agents that proactively try to satisfy their goals. The mechanism to achieve this dialogs is based in the specialization of the mental state of agents, by means of the partial deduction of rule bases.

BRNeural - Artificial Neural Networks Simulator with Topology Multilayer Perceptron Using the Encog Framework	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Networks; agriculture; agrometeorological data		The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach has had been applied in solutions for several problems such as classification, prediction and pattern recognition. Mostly, these problems belong to diversified areas of knowledge, not necessarily related to Computer Science, e.g. in agriculture, specifically in precision agriculture, recognition of diseases in plants, among others. Therefore, it is possible to visualize the multidisciplinary feature that ANNs have, motivating the development of tools for simulating more generic ANN, making its use possible by users whose knowledge of this type of methodology isn't deep. Inside this context, the just described work has had the goal of developing a tool that is part of the BRNeural research project, whose main goal was the development of a simulator named BRNeural (Brasil Neural) which is focused on the scientific and professional community since one of its proposals is to offer a generic environment to aid the creation, train and operate with ANNs. This tool consists in a module for training and testing ANNs with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) topology and it was developed using the ENCOG framework. For validating this module and all implemented training algorithms, the simulator was submitted to pattern recognition tests using agrometeorological data such as temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind direction, wind speed and temperature of leaf wetness, comparing the results obtained with another simulator which was developed using the MLP framework (Medeiros, 2003) with the specific purpose of classifying diseases in severity indexes. After validating, the simulator was submitted to other pattern recognition tests whose goal was the classification of diseases in the wheat like Blight, Spot blotch and Mildew in severity indexes through agrometeorological variables, showing its features such as output normalizations and the training algorithms Backpropagation, Resilient propagation and Quick propagation. The best results were obtained with the tests for the classification of diseases using severity indexes, 83.63% correct answers for Blight using the Quick propagation training algorithm and Equilateral normalization, 86.95% of correct answers for Mildew with Resilient Propagation algorithm and OneOf normalization and, for Spot blotch, 91.96% correct answers with Quick and Resilient Propagation algorithms, both using Equilateral normalization.

Design: Prospective, multi-center sub-study. Setting: Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network Cohort (ECHORN) Study, with study sites in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados. Participants: Community-residing adults without a diagnosis of HTN and not taking antihypertensive medication. Intervention: Ambulatory BP patterns are assessed using 24-hour ABPM. Contextual factors are assessed with: ecological momentary assessment (7-item survey of experiences, exposures and responses associated with daytime BP measurements); actigraphy (capturing physical activity and sleep quality); and self-report surveys (assessing physical and social health, environmental and social stressors and supports). Main Outcome Measures: Phenotypes of contextual factors associated with hypertensive BP patterns (sustained HTN, masked HTN, and nocturnal non-dipping) Methods and Results: This study will enroll 500 participants; assessments of blood pressure and contextual factors will be conducted during Waves 2 and 3 of the ECHORN parent study, occurring 2 years apart. In Wave 2, we will assess the association between contextual factors and ABPM patterns. Using advanced analytic clustering methods, we will identify phenotypes of contextual factors associated with hypertensive ABPM patterns. We will then test the stability of these phenotypes and their ability to predict change in ABPM patterns between Waves 2 and 3. Conclusions: Assessment of ABPM, and the contextual factors influencing ABPM, can identify unique phenotypes of HTN, which can then be used to develop more precision-based approaches to the prevention, detection and treatment of HTN in high-risk populations.

Coral reef scientists are therefore challenged with the task of providing prompt and relevant inputs for science-based decision-making. Here, we provide a baseline dataset, covering 1300km of tropical coral reef habitats globally, and comprised of over one million geo-referenced, high-resolution photo-quadrats analysed using artificial intelligence to automatically estimate the proportional cover of benthic components. The dataset contains information on five major reef regions, and spans 2012-2018, including surveys before and after the 2016 global bleaching event. The taxonomic resolution attained by image analysis, as well as the spatially explicit nature of the images, allow for multi-scale spatial analyses, temporal assessments (decline and recovery), and serve for supporting image recognition developments. This standardised dataset across broad geographies offers a significant contribution towards a sound baseline for advancing our understanding of coral reef ecology and thereby taking collective and informed actions to mitigate catastrophic losses in coral reefs worldwide.

A Load Prioritization Model for a Microgrid Operation in the Islanded Mode	2020 IEEE PES TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION - LATIN AMERICA (T&D LA)	Proceedings of the IEEE-PES Transmission & Distribution Conference and Exposition Latin America		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exhibition - Latin America (T and D LA)	SEP 28-OCT 02, 2020	Montevideo, URUGUAY	IEEE PES		load prioritization; microgrids in islanded mode; optimization; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP)	ENERGY MANAGEMENT	This work presents a load prioritization approach for a microgrid centralized-controller operating in islanded mode. The optimization in islanded mode aims to maximize the provision of the loads while following a list of priorities, which is set by the user. Controllable loads can be dragged within the priority list according to the user's preferences. Loads and groups of loads take priority among others according to their position on the list. In addition, the user may set preferences according to: the loads and groups of loads' supply options; the amount of energy that must be saved as a backup during connected mode in order to being able to meet selected loads in an occasional islanded mode; and which loads should be automatically shut down in the islanded mode. We present a mathematical model to describe these options, as well as simulations and results.	[Gloria, Luna L.; Costa, Gabriel H. S.; Oliveira, Debora B.

Visual Analysis to Generate and Validate Geographical Heuristics	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						visualizations; visual inspection; geographical heuristics; machine learning	SEGREGATION; CHILE	The popularity of smartphones has opened endless possibilities for researchers. The adoption of these devices by all kind of users has transformed each one of them into a mobile sensor that can measure different types of data. These data can eventually be transmitted via Internet to servers where it can be studied to understand different aspects of the environment and human behavior in ways that were not possible a few years ago. Even with all this information available, the granularity of the data can be coarse, and the amount of it can be scarce, making it difficult to study and evaluate such data. This is especially true for certain geographically-related problems, where conventional algorithms are difficult to design. For these problems it is possible to design heuristics to reach a good approximation, however the methodology to assess the effectiveness of such heuristics is unclear. In this paper we present our work towards a methodology to generate and evaluate such heuristics. This methodology is based on displaying geographical information visually so human evaluators can judge the quality of the heuristic and combining it with the calculation power of computers.

We developed three specific objectives. First, we designed the architecture of the MAS that manages the resources and activities in a virtual learning environment (VLE), for which we used the related works on MAS in a VLE. Second, we implement the architecture of the MAS, the prototype proposed has been called GREAC (Gestion de Recursos y Actividades), which considers the learning style (LS) of the student to manage the resources and activities in an adaptive way, and uses the methodology Prometheus, Moodle 3.6 (VLE), and the framework Jade, for the development of the prototype of the MAS. Third, we evaluated the prototype GREAC in a SaCI in an academic context. In the evaluation participated 54 students from the Universidad Nacional de Loja, of the Carrera de Ingenieria en Sistemas. As a result of the evaluation by the students, we obtained a level of satisfaction 92.6 %. Finally, this work concludes that the implementation of a MAS in a VLE allows the dynamic management of resources and activities, taking into account the students LS, allowing an adaptive and personalized management.

Bio-Inspired Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Navigation of Artificial Agents	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Reinforcement Learning; Autonomous Navigation; Visual Models		Autonomous navigation of artificial agents is a challenging task for changing and complex environments. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are widely used for autonomous navigation, where the agent, through the interaction with the environment, learns the behaviors needed to maximize the reward. Recent architectures extract information from the environment using convolutional neural networks, where the visual features needed to maximize the reward are unknown and uncertain, and then, increasing the number of parameters learned by the entire system. Moreover, the presence of sparse rewards complicates, even more, the task generating unstable results in the learning problem. The work here presented is twofold. First, we show the advantages of using retina physiology knowledge to design a visual sensor feeding the RL network. Secondly, based on intrinsic motivation, we propose the use of auxiliary tasks to deal with sparse rewards, generating a continuous learning process. We define two auxiliary tasks, state, and action predictions, forcing the network to learn characteristics of environment; and also, to detect which of them are valuable for the task. These two contributions were implemented in the DeepMind Lab environment simulating an agent moving inside two different maze scenarios. The results obtained reveal a promising extension of the inclusion of biological-plausible mechanisms inside artificial intelligence applications. Moreover, to include auxiliary tasks improves the performance adding robustness to the system.

Thus we verify if they can be used in wearable systems and adapted to existing devices of the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling the proposition of efficient and accessible assistive product recognition systems.

Prediction of Aggressive Comments in Social Media: an Exploratory Study	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						aggressiveness; social media; prediction; artificial neural networks; support vector machines		This paper presents a set of techniques for predicting aggressive comments in social media. In a time when cyberbullying has, unfortunately, made its entrance into society and Internet, it becomes necessary to find ways for preventing and overcoming this phenomenon. One of these concerns the use of machine learning techniques for automatically detecting cases of cyberbullying; a primary task within this cyberbullying detection consists of aggressive text detection. We concretely explore different computational techniques for carrying out this task, either as a classification or as a regression problem, and our results suggest that a key feature is the identification of profane words.

Mexican Sign Language Alphanumerical Gestures Recognition using 3D Haar-like Features	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Boosting; Gesture recognition; Sign language; Machine learning; 3D Haar-like features		The Mexican Sign Language (LSM) is a language of the deaf Mexican community, which consists of a series of gestural signs articulated by hands and accompanied with facial expressions. The lack of automated systems to translate signs from LSM makes integration of hearing-impaired people to society more difficult. This work presents a new method for LSM alphanumerical signs recognition based on 3D Haar-like features extracted from depth images captured by the Microsoft Kinect sensor. Features are processed with a boosting algorithm. To evaluate performance of our method, we recognized a set of signs from letters and numbers, and compared the results with the use of traditional 2D Haar-like features. Our system is able to recognize static LSM signs with a higher accuracy rate than the one obtained with widely used 2D features.

WASE-COVID Investigators	Echocardiographic Correlates of In-Hospital Death in Patients with Acute COVID-19 Infection: The World Alliance Societies of Echocardiography (WASE-COVID) Study	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY			English	Article						Echocardiography; WASE; International; COVID-19; Mortality; Strain	RIGHT-VENTRICULAR FAILURE; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; MYOCARDIAL INJURY; TROPONIN; ASSOCIATION; MORTALITY	Background: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 virus, which has led to the global coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is known to adversely affect the cardiovascular system through multiple mechanisms. In this international, multicenter study conducted by the World Alliance Societies of Echocardiography, we aim to determine the clinical and echocardiographic phenotype of acute cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients, to explore phenotypic differences in different geographic regions across the world, and to identify parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. Methods: We studied 870 patients with acute COVID-19 infection from 13 medical centers in four world regions (Asia, Europe, United States, Latin America) who had undergone transthoracic echocardiograms. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, including patient outcomes. Anonymized echocardiograms were analyzed with automated, machine learning-derived algorithms to calculate left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction, and LV longitudinal strain (LS). Right-sided echocardiographic parameters that were measured included right ventricular (RV) LS, RV free-wall strain (FWS), and RV basal diameter. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and echocardiographic parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. Results: Significant regional differences were noted in terms of patient comorbidities, severity of illness, clinical biomarkers, and LV and RV echocardiographic metrics. Overall in-hospital mortality was 21.6%. Parameters associated with mortality in a multivariate analysis were age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12 [1.05, 1.22], P = .003), previous lung disease (OR = 7.32 [1.56, 42.2], P = .015), LVLS (OR = 1.18 [1.05, 1.36], P = .012), lactic dehydrogenase (OR = 6.17 [1.74, 28.7], P = .009), and RVFWS (OR = 1.14 [1.04, 1.26], P = .007). Conclusions: Left ventricular dysfunction is noted in approximately 20% and RV dysfunction in approximately 30% of patients with acute COVID-19 illness and portend a poor prognosis. Age at presentation, previous lung disease, lactic dehydrogenase, LVLS, and RVFWS were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Regional differences in cardiac phenotype highlight the significant differences in patient acuity as well as echo cardiographic utilization in different parts of the world.

J	Finn, A; Kumar, P; Peters, S; O'Hehir, J				Finn, Anthony; Kumar, Pankaj; Peters, Stefan; O'Hehir, Jim			Unsupervised spectral-spatial processing of drone imagery for identification of pine seedlings	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						UAV; Seedling identification; Forest establishment; Object detection; Unsupervised learning	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; STAND DENSITY; TREE-CROWN; UAV LIDAR; FOREST; CLASSIFICATION; RESTORATION	Reliable and accurate monitoring of replanted forest areas is a vital component of the plantation cycle if sustainable management practices are to be maintained following resource extraction. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can rapidly survey newly planted forest areas using high resolution imagery. Automated image processing techniques can cost-effectively examine large quantities of data. Correctly combined, such technologies can efficiently create accurate maps of seedling locations, which offers the prospect of management practices for forestry and ecology operations that involve less fieldwork. This paper presents a technique based on unsupervised machine learning for detecting healthy young pinus caribaea (Caribbean pine) and pinus radiata (Monterey pine) seedlings. The locations of individual trees requiring replacement are also determined based on the spatial distribution of the identified healthy trees. The approach was tested on data from 30 sites covering over 700 ha, with seedlings ranging from 9 months to 3 years' old (mean tree heights 30-2 m). Test sites contained a range of geomorphologies and levels of weed infestation. The results indicate detection precision and specificity in excess of 90% and recall approaching 99% for dense point cloud resolution of 4-6 cm. As network pre-training is unnecessary, there is no need for high resolution imagery, which allows greater operational coverage per unit time. The algorithm may also be used on multi-or hyperspectral data; and may be useful if employed in conjunction with other supervised learning techniques to reduce the need for manual labelling of training data sets.

Emmett			The Coral Reef Sentinels Program: A Mars Shot for Blue Planetary Health	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL			English	Article								Up to 90% of global coral reefs are predicted to be severely degraded by 2050 under "business-as-usual" scenarios. To meet the scale and scope of this challenge, we propose designing and demonstrating a multi-modal system that can incorporate data from remote sensing (satellites, aircraft, and aerial drones), acoustics, genetics, sensor arrays, and low-cost imaging systems. The latter will be collected by low-cost smart sensing and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) guided by adaptive sampling modeling software and rapidly analyzed using automated machine learning systems. Development and deployment will be linked to extensive and diversity-enhancing training programs. The Coral Sentinel System will be globally deployed to enable rapid-response adaptive management and to build public engagement in conservation interventions to save coral reefs. Phase 1 (Year 1) will involve testing assumptions, coalition building, fundraising, and initial system development. Phase 2 (Years 2-4) will focus on engineering and development with a pilot deployment in the Caribbean. Phase 3 (Years 5-6) will involve system expansion and iteration along the Tropical Eastern Pacific corridor. Phase 4 (Years 7-10) will involve global deployment to over 50 reef sites. This will lead during the following decade (Phase 5) to provisioning of low-cost Sentinel systems to coastal communities globally.

A Data Governance Framework for Industry 4.0	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Data governance; Monitoring; Real-time systems; Industrial Internet of Things; IEEE transactions; Data models; Big Data; Data governance; Data-Centric architecture; Industry 4; 0; Big Data; Real Time		The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, represents a new stage of evolution in the organization, management and control of the value chain throughout the product or service life cycle. This digitization of the industrial environment is characterized by the connection of Information Technologies (IT) and Operations Technologies (OT) through cyber-physical systems and the Industrial IoT (IIoT). One of the main consequences of this integration is the increasing amount and variety of data generated in real time from different sources. In this environment of intensive generation of actionable information, data becomes a critical asset for Industry 4.0, at all stages of the value chain. However, in order to data become a competitive advantage for the company, it must be managed and governed like any other strategic asset, and therefore it is necessary to rely on a Data Governance system. Industry 4.0 requires a reformulation of governance since the data is a key element and the backbone of the processes of the organization. This paper proposes a Reference Framework for the implementation of Data Governance Systems for Industry 4.0. Previously, it contextualizes data governance for Industry 4.0 environments and identifies the requirements that this framework must address, which are conditioned by the specific features of Industry 4.0, among others, the intensive use of big data, cloud and edge computing, artificial intelligence and current regulations.

Moreover, VSIs have been described as products of inequality designed to segregate and hinder integration between public and private urban spaces. This study assesses VSIs across six cities in Brazil, a country notable for its profound inequality and sociospatial fragmentation. The main aims of this research are: (i) to develop and test a predictive model for VSIs using socioeconomic indicators drawn from open-source ground-truth data; (ii) to identify the variance of VSI within selected case studies. In the development phase of the predictive model, data from the city of Recife are used to build the model. The testing phase involves the analysis of VSIs in the cities of Fortaleza, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba and Porto Alegre. The model can potentially assist urban planners in better understanding and locating VSIs and mitigating undesirable outcomes.

However, the effect of land use change on soil properties is often unknown due to poor access to remote areas. Effective management and conservation of soils requires the development spatial approaches that measure and predict dynamic soil properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC). This study estimates the SOC stock in the Eastern Plains of Colombia, with validation and uncertainty analyses, using legacy data of 653 soil samples. A random forest model of nine environmental covariate layers was used to develop predictions of SOC content. Model validation was determined using the Taylor series method, and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and mean error (ME) were calculated to assess model performance. We found that the model explained 50.28% of the variation within digital SOC content map. Raster layers of SOC content, bulk density, and coarse rock fragment within the Eastern Plains were used to calculate SOC stock within the region. With uncertainty, SOC stock in the topsoil of the Eastern Plains was 1.2 G t ha(-1). We found that SOC content contributed nearly all the uncertainty in the SOC stock predictions, although better determinations of SOC stock can be obtained with the use of a more geomorphological diverse dataset. The digital soil maps developed in this study provide predictions of extant SOC content and stock in the topsoil of the Eastern Plains, important soil information that may provide insight into the development of research, regulatory, and legislative initiatives to conserve and manage this evolving ecosystem.

Determination of the seismic signatures of landslides in soft soils: A methodology based on a field scale shear box	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Field shear box; Microseismic monitoring; Landslides		We present a novel field experimental setup that can be used for studying the characteristics of landslide seismicity. The setup consists of a concrete, filled with soil, cylinder that moves along a surficial soil corridor. The emitted seismic signals are due to soil friction. The cylinder acts as an upscaled sheer-box allowing control over a number of parameters: the magnitude of normal stress on the failure plane, the degree of saturation and the type of soil. This allows for the simulation of soil friction within, or between, different geological layers under different conditions. Results are site specific, but can be easily reproduced for any geological environment. We validate this methodology by comparing the spectral characteristics of the signals emitted by the movement of the cylinder to those induced by a controlled failure of a 2.5 m high vertical face at a nearby site with very similar geology. We find a very good agreement between the two.

In view of the above difficulties, this paper proposes a small object detection algorithm based on multi-scale feature fusion. By learning shallow features at the shallow level and deep features at the deep level, the proposed multi-scale feature learning scheme focuses on the fusion of concrete features and abstract features. It constructs object detector (MSFYOLO) based on multi-scale deep feature learning network and considers the relationship between a single object and local environment. Combining global information with local information, the feature pyramid is constructed by fusing different depth feature layers in the network. In addition, this paper also proposes a new feature extraction network (CourNet), through the way of feature visualization compared with the mainstream backbone network, the network can better express the small object feature information. The proposed algorithm is valuated on the MS COCO and achieved leading performance with 11.7% improvement in FPS, 17.0% improvement in AP, 81.0% improvement in ARS, and 23.3% reduction in computational FPLOs compared to YOLOv3. This study shows that the combination of global information and local information is helpful to detect the expression of small objects in different illumination. MSFYOLO uses CourNet as the backbone network, which has high efficiency and a good balance between accuracy and speed.

Currently, there is an increasing interest in predicting the behavior of active work items in any business process, which would make possible to monitor the behavior of such processes in a more accurate way. Given the complexity of current business processes, conventional techniques are not always effective in addressing this type of requirements; therefore, machine learning techniques are being increasingly more used for this task. This work deals with the problem of fail detection in a BPM system from event logs, based on machine learning methods. The paper explores the use of two structural learning models, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM). Both models are suitable to model sequence data, but the last one can take into consideration the duration time that the underlying process remains in one state. The experiments are carried out using a real database of about 460,000 event logs sequences. The results show that for the given dataset, fail detection can be achieved with an accuracy of 86.70% using the HSMM model. In order to reduce the computational load of the proposed approach, the models were implemented in a distributed processing environment using Apache Spark, which guarantees the scalability of the solution.

This is how Blockchain-based techniques are being applied to many fields, focusing in this article on the public sector, as a possible solution to the demands for transparency, participation and citizen cooperation that society demands; due to the possibility of disintermediation based on automated transactions and on the responsibility and security in the management of official blockchain records. This could obstruct corruption and make government services more transparent and efficient. Although, it investigates about applications in the public sector under the Blockchain system, such as transactions, agreements, property registries and innovations, developments and other assets; Special emphasis is placed on the possibility of implementing Smart Contracts (mechanisms that aim to eliminate intermediaries to simplify processes) in public procurement procedures, given that it is in this type of activity where high levels of corruption are generated. It is concluded then that Europe has the largest number of blockchain initiatives worldwide, while Latin America, except for the case of Peru, lacks this type of applications, being this continent exactly where there are the countries with the highest levels of corruption. It concludes with a recommendation to use blockchain along with smart contracts through platforms such as Ethereum or Lisk, mainly given its flexibility and current development on topics with similar functionalities.

However, its current distribution and high-risk areas are little known. We conducted a modelling study to determine the areas with highest prevalence of MAYV occurrence in South America, based on confirmed cases and serological detection over the last 20 years and socio-environmental variables. We performed our analysis using Maxent software, a machine learning algorithm used for species distribution modeling. Our results showed that the occurrence of MAYV is mainly associated with the biome type, population density, annual rainfall, annual vapor rate, and elevation. Among biome types, the one most related to the occurrence of MAYV is Cerrado, probably related to the lifecycle of the Haemagogus vector and human population concentrations. According to our modelling, there is high yet undetectable MAYV concentration in the central region of Brazil and west-coastal region of the continent. A change in virus dispersion patterns was observed. The virus was previously predominantly in forests but now occupied rural areas and was becoming increasingly urbanized, which is increases the risk of outbreaks. Our results will serve to identify priority areas in the development of preventive actions and structuring of epidemiological surveillance.

Lewis			Data-Driven Development and Evaluation of Enskill English	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION			English	Article						Development methodologies for AIED systems; Iterative design; Experimental studies; Educational design research; Computer-aided language learning; Dialogue systems	INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM	Cloud computing offers developers of learning environments access to unprecedented amounts of learner data. This makes possible data-driven development (D-3) of learning environments. In the D-3 approach the learning environment is a data collection tool as well a learning tool. It continually collects data from interactions with learners, which is used in ongoing evaluation and iterative development. Iterative development cycles become very rapid, limited by the time required to analyze data and deploy system updates. D-3 is particularly relevant to fielded AIED systems that operate in uncontrolled conditions, where learners may behave in unexpected ways. This article presents two snapshot case studies in the data-driven development of Enskill((R)) English, a system for learning to speak English as a foreign language. In the first trial at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia two versions of Enskill English's dialogue system were tested simultaneously: the released version and a new version incorporating statistical natural language processing technology. A new version was released and data were collected from a second snapshot evaluation at the University of Split, Croatia. Data from learners in Latin America and Europe were analyzed for comparison. The evaluations provided preliminary evidence that Enskill English is helpful for learning spoken English skills, and leading indicators that learner performance improves through practice with Enskill English. They suggest that Enskill English can be extended to meet the needs of more advanced learners who wish to use English in a professional context. Broader recommendations for data-driven development of intelligent learning environments are presented.	[Johnson, W.

SVM and ANN Application to Multivariate Pattern Recognition Using Scatter Data	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Multivariate patterns; SVM; Fuzzy ARTMAP; PCA; univariate patterns	OF-CONTROL SIGNALS; STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL; NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLE; MANUFACTURING PROCESSES; MODEL	several methods of Statistical Process Control (SPC) are used to analyze process measurements with the purpose to detect faults that affect the process stability. SPC has a major drawback because it indicates the presence of faults without explaining which ones and where are the faults. In practical applications, SPC just analyses univariate signals limiting the study of multiple measures. Nowadays, novel methods have been developed for fault analysis based on pattern recognition in control charts. However, the majority of these studies follow a univariate approach. This article proposes a multivariate pattern recognition approach using machine learning algorithms in conjunction with a scatter diagram as the proposed method. In particular the aim of this approach is to monitor quality characteristics of a product in a multivariate environment considering states in control and out of control without the constraints of statistical conditions with the possibility of its application in real time. Results using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the FuzzyARTMAP neural network showed that multivariate patterns can be recognized successfully in 81% of the cases.

Yet, most research is undermined by low interpretability and specificity. Methods Combining statistical and machine learning analyses of natural speech data, we aimed to discriminate ADD patients from healthy controls (HCs) based on automated measures of domains typically affected in ADD: semantic granularity (coarseness of concepts) and ongoing semantic variability (conceptual closeness of successive words). To test for specificity, we replicated the analyses on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Results Relative to controls, ADD (but not PD) patients exhibited significant differences in both measures. Also, these features robustly discriminated between ADD patients and HC, while yielding near-chance classification between PD patients and HCs. Discussion Automated discourse-level semantic analyses can reveal objective, interpretable, and specific markers of ADD, bridging well-established neuropsychological targets with digital assessment tools.

A.; Peedell, Stephen; Szantoi, Zoltan			High-resolution global map of smallholder and industrial closed-canopy oil palm plantations	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							DATA AUGMENTATION	Oil seed crops, especially oil palm, are among the most rapidly expanding agricultural land uses, and their expansion is known to cause significant environmental damage. Accordingly, these crops often feature in public and policy debates which are hampered or biased by a lack of accurate information on environmental impacts. In particular, the lack of accurate global crop maps remains a concern. Recent advances in deep-learning and remotely sensed data access make it possible to address this gap. We present a map of closed-canopy oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations by typology (industrial versus smallholder plantations) at the global scale and with unprecedented detail (10m resolution) for the year 2019. The DeepLabv3+ model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation, was trained to classify Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images onto an oil palm land cover map. The characteristic backscatter response of closed-canopy oil palm stands in Sentinel-1 and the ability of CNN to learn spatial patterns, such as the harvest road networks, allowed the distinction between industrial and smallholder plantations globally (overall accuracy = 98.52 +/- 0.20%), outperforming the accuracy of existing regional oil palm datasets that used conventional machine-learning algorithms. The user's accuracy, reflecting commission error, in industrial and smallholders was 88.22 +/- 2.73% and 76.56 +/- 4.53%, and the producer's accuracy, reflecting omission error, was 75.78 +/- 3.55% and 86.92 +/- 5.12 %, respectively. The global oil palm layer reveals that closed-canopy oil palm plantations are found in 49 countries, covering a mapped area of 19.60 Mha; the area estimate was 21.00 +/- 0.42 Mha (72.7% industrial and 27.3% smallholder plantations). Southeast Asia ranks as the main producing region with an oil palm area estimate of 18.69 +/- 0.33 Mha or 89% of global closed-canopy plantations. Our analysis confirms significant regional variation in the ratio of industrial versus smallholder growers, but it also confirms that, from a typical land development perspective, large areas of legally defined smallholder oil palm resemble industrial-scale plantings. Since our study identified only closed-canopy oil palm stands, our area estimate was lower than the harvested area reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), particularly in West Africa, due to the omission of young and sparse oil palm stands, oil palm in nonhomogeneous settings, and semi-wild oil palm plantations. An accurate global map of planted oil palm can help to shape the ongoing debate about the environmental impacts of oil seed crop expansion, especially if other crops can be mapped to the same level of accuracy. As our model can be regularly rerun as new images become available, it can be used to monitor the expansion of the crop in monocultural settings. The global oil palm layer for the second half of 2019 at a spatial resolution of 10m can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4473715 (Descals et al., 2021).

If the consumption pattern of each of these devices is identified, then the management will be more efficient, reducing both the billing and the CO2 emissions. This paper proposes a model for the recognition of energy consumption patterns in household appliances, based on the capture of electrical parameters in connected appliances, through Smart Socket with an Intrusive Load Monitoring approach. The data acquisition system corresponds to an-Internet of Things (IoT) platform that uses Automatic Meter Reading devices, connected to a IoT-gateway via Wi-Fi to send data to an application on the web. For the recognition of the patterns, machine learning techniques are used. Accuracy results on pattern identification are obtained about 91% after applying a backpropagation method in an Artificial Neural Network in time basis. Through this work, the prediction of consumer categories in household appliances, with high levels of reliability and under multiple operating states, is reached. These results enhance the efficient management of energy in a Smart Home and Smart Cities environment	[Ulloa-Vasquez, F.; Heredia-Figueroa, V] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana UTEM, Programa Invest Radiocomunicac Digital PIRD, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Garcia-Santander, L.] Univ Concepcion, Dept Ingn Elect, Concepcion, Chile; [Carrizo, D.] Univ Atacama, Dept Ciencias Computac, Copiapo, Chile		Ulloa-Vasquez, F (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Metropolitana UTEM, Programa Invest Radiocomunicac Digital PIRD, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile.	fulloa@utem.cl; luis.garcia@udec.cl; dante.carrizo@uda.cl; victor.herediaf@utem.cl		Garcia-Santander, Luis/0000-0002-6474-6528					30	1	1	3	3	IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC	PISCATAWAY	445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA	1548-0992			IEEE LAT AM T	IEEE Latin Am.

On-line recognition of emotions via electroencephalography	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Brain modeling; Electroencephalography; Emotion recognition; Real-time systems; Support vector machines; Filtering; Face recognition; Emotion Recognition; Brain-Computer Interface; Electroencephalography; On-line Processing	EEG	Automated pattern recognition of brain signals can bring about new experiences, enhancing applications in a wide array of areas. One of its fields of study is the recognition of emotions via electroencephalography (EEG), which shows exclusive advantages compared to other methods. However, research with brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is usually structured in two sequential stages: data collection and data analysis. These stages leave a gap in the perspective of a functional system in a production environment since the practitioner needs to wait a considerable length of time until they can see the results of the current activity. An on-line classification system of emotions (positive, neutral, and negative) was developed using open resources in this work. Five machine learning models were trained with the SEED IV dataset, which is labeled with different emotions. The models were trained and tested using nested cross-validation and grid search to obtain the best hyperparameters. The algorithm implementation in Python was integrated with the OpenBCI software to capture the EEG signals, process them, and command the simulations. The best average accuracy obtained for a single subject was 76.19%, and the average accuracy for all subjects was 57.07%. The average execution time for signal processing and prediction, combined, was around one millisecond, which demonstrates the potential for applications with real-time characteristics.	[Weiss, K. A.

Wide acceptance has been delayed because of the limitations in accuracy, speed, automation and generalization of these methods. This work introduces a novel technique, the Automated Canopy Estimator (ACE) that overcomes many of these challenges to produce accurate estimates of fractional vegetation cover using an unsupervised segmentation process. ACE is shown to outperform nine other segmentation algorithms, consisting of both threshold-based and machine learning approaches, in the segmentation of photographs of four different crops (oat, corn, rapeseed and flax) with an overall accuracy of 89.6%. ACE is similarly accurate (88.7%) when applied to remotely sensed corn, producing FVC estimates that are strongly correlated with ground truth values.

Moreover, their stochastic extensions have enabled risk-aware path planning, which explicitly limits the probability of failure to a user-specified bound. However, a major challenge of those path planning methods is constraint violation between discrete time steps. In the existing approach, a path is represented by a sequence of waypoints and the safety constraints (e.g., obstacle avoidance) are imposed on waypoints. Therefore, the trajectory between waypoints could violate the safety constraints. A naive continuous-time extension results in unrealistic computation cost. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to ensure constraint satisfaction between waypoints without employing a continuous-time formulation. The key idea is to enforce that the same inequality constraint is satisfied on any two adjacent time steps, under assumptions of polygonal obstacles and straight line trajectory between waypoints. The resulting problem encoding is MILP, which can be solved efficiently by commercial solvers. Thus, we also introduce novel extensions to risk-allocation path planners with improved scalability for real-world scenarios and run-time performance. While the proposed encoding approach is general, the particular emphasis of this paper is placed on the chance-constrained, nonconvex path-planning problem (CNPP). We provide extensive simulation results on CNPP to demonstrate the path safety and scalability of our encoding and related path planners.

Design And Implementation Of A Low-Cost Universal Control For Intelligent Electric Wheelchairs	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Intelligent; low cost; Universal Control Device; Wheelchair		Electric wheelchairs are a fundamental tool for millions of people all over the world. Thanks to this type of wheelchairs persons who suffer from reduced mobility can go about their normal lives. Numerous research works had been carried out with the aim of improving the quality of life of people who are bound to a wheelchair, focusing on the creation of novel control interfaces. Through these interfaces, wheelchair users can have control of it using their voice, simple gestures or eye movement. However, if we look objectively at these interfaces, they are all developed on the basis of a different control system, making it difficult to embed these solutions in real environments. Currently, there is no universal control device which would act as a link between the user's wheelchair and the developed control interfaces. In this work, we propose the design of a low-cost, universal control board for the control of the wheelchairs' trajectory, so that any systems integrator of control interface can use it for both research and the development of prototypes that will improve the quality of life in our society.

Investing in Late-Life Brain Capital	INNOVATION IN AGING			English	Article						Aging; Brain health; Innovation; Mental disorders; Neuroscience; Psychiatry		Within many societies and cultures around the world, older adults are too often undervalued and underappreciated. This exacerbates many key challenges that older adults may face. It also undermines the many positive aspects of late life that are of tremendous value at both an individual and societal level. We propose a new approach to elevate health and well-being in late life by optimizing late-life Brain Capital. This form of capital prioritizes brain skills and brain health in a brain economy, which the challenges and opportunities of the 21st-century demands. This approach incorporates investing in late-life Brain Capital, developing initiatives focused on building late-life Brain Capital.

The main challenge is the difference between research projects and scientific literature. Research projects are a collection of information in different formats and available in different places. Even projects from the same funding call follow a different structure in most of the cases, despite there were some requirements that they should meet at the end of the funding period. Furthermore, the sources in which the scientific literature is available provide metadata and powerful search tools, meanwhile most of the research projects are not stored in public and accessible databases, or the databases usually do not provide enough information and tools to conduct a systematic search. For this reason, this work provides the guidelines to support systematics reviews of research projects following the method called Systematic Research Projects Review (SRPR). This methodology is based on the Kitchenham's adaptation of the systematic literature review.
