As governments of developing countries continue to shift to more advanced digital platforms, they have adopted practices and policies that have a direct impact on the future of AI-based technology. This research aims to discuss factors that may have a direct impact on the AI preparedness of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries. It evaluates a recent ranking developed by the international development research center (IDRC) focused on indicators towards the development or use of AI technology in governance, infrastructure, technological skills, and public services against each country's economic metrics including unemployment rate, gross domestic product per capita purchasing power parity (GDP-PPP), cost to hire an AI researcher, and countrywide education levels. It also reviews metrics and factors outside of economics which have a direct impact on AI readiness and its effects on each country's citizens, including automation potential and data privacy policies. This research discusses current issues with existing evaluation criteria for AI readiness and expands factors and considerations essential to LAC countries as they embrace the AI revolution.

The integration of automation and artificial intelligence into the logistics sector A Caribbean perspective	WORLDWIDE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM THEMES			English	Article						Caribbean; Logistics; Automation; Artificial intelligence; Shipping; Blue economy		Purpose Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are technologies that make a global impact by optimizing manual and time-intensive processes using data analytics and robotics, thus making the task more efficient, effective and less time-consuming. This is represented in the cyber-physical context, in which humans and technologies are allowed to coexist and learn from each other. Design/methodology/approach The logistics and supply chain sector consists of numerous partners and stakeholders, and despite the limited inclusion of automation and AI within the sector, there are still many manual and repetitive tasks. Findings Stakeholders in the logistics and supply chain sector are creating awareness and slowly implementing AI and automation within their operations. The majority of shipping and logistics is done through the maritime sector, and this is expected to increase in line with the world's population. Originality/value The purpose of this paper is to examine statistical data on the understanding of automation and AI within education, the port authority and major operators in the shipping and logistics sector throughout the Caribbean.

ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE STRATEGIES IN LATIN AMERICA: A STUDY OF THE ETHICS AND HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACHES	REVISTA DE GESTION PUBLICA			Spanish	Article						Artificial intelligence; National strategies; Human rights; Ethics; Latin America		This study seeks to analyze the differences and similarities in the characteristics of national artificial intelligence (AI) strategies in the public sector of different Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay. The methodological and analytical strategy consists in showing and analyzing their characteristics based on the following categories of analysis: objectives, principles, pillars/measures and vision/goals. The analysis examines the ethics and human rights dimensions. From the research, it could be inferred and concluded that the countries' efforts to implement AI in the public sector are at an emerging stage and are achieving significant progress. In addition, the strategies have similarities in terms of the ethical and human rights approaches while their differences are conditioned by the political-administrative and technological approaches to which they are subject.

J	Salas-Pilco, SZ; Yang, YQ				Salas-Pilco, Sdenka Zobeida; Yang, Yuqin			Artificial intelligence applications in Latin American higher education: a systematic review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Review						Artificial intelligence (AI); Higher education; Latin America; Machine learning; Deep learning; Natural language processing; Algorithm; Systematic review	PREDICTING ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; TEACHER PERFORMANCE; NEURAL-NETWORKS	Over the last decade, there has been great research interest in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, such as medicine, finance, and law. Recently, there has been a research focus on the application of AI in education, where it has great potential. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on AI in education is therefore necessary. This article considers its usage and applications in Latin American higher education institutions. After identifying the studies dedicated to educational innovations brought about by the application of AI techniques, this review examines AI applications in three educational processes: learning, teaching, and administration. Each study is analyzed for the AI techniques used, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, the AI tools and algorithms that are applied, and the main education topic. The results reveal that the main AI applications in education are: predictive modelling, intelligent analytics, assistive technology, automatic content analysis, and image analytics. It is further demonstrated that AI applications help to address important education issues (e.g., detecting students at risk of dropping out) and thereby contribute to ensuring quality education. Finally, the article presents the lessons learned from the review concerning the application of AI technologies in higher education in the Latin American context.

There are many reasons for a student to deserted of their studies. However, the importance of identifying the level of risk related to such desertion is reflected in the socio-economic impact for the institutions as well as for the country. Technological advancements in database management and artificial intelligence have led to the development of techniques such as Machine Learning, which supports decision-making when facing a problem and adapts accordingly to the required conditions. The following article shows a case study of the identification of students in Industrial Engineering at risk of dropping out in the Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas from the 2003-1 to 2018-1 academic semesters. The algorithm is selected based on which is more suitable to the nature of data, through the comparison of automated learning techniques in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

These challenges are similar in different countries of the region and transcend national borders. The increasing digital transformation of health care holds promise of more precise interventions, improved health outcomes, increased efficiency, and ultimately reduced health-care costs. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the adoption of digital health tools is in early stages and the quality of cancer registries, electronic health records, and structured databases are problematic. Cancer research and innovation in the region are limited due to inadequate academic resources and translational research is almost fully dependent on public funding. Regulatory complexity and extended timelines jeopardise the potential improvement in participation in international studies. Emerging technologies, artificial intelligence, big data, and cancer research represent an opportunity to address the health-care challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean collectively, by optimising national capacities, sharing and comparing best practices, and transferring scientific and technical capabilities.

First it analyzes the effects of the exponential acceleration within the realm of data processing that lead to the optimization of various human activities, to then consider how the incorporation of such technologies will necessarily entail a new approach to achieve the proper transition toward a system compatible with human rights. In this respect, it is emphasized that development asymmetries are often followed by the need to protect and guarantee the effectiveness of rights, which will require that technological advances be oriented towards inclusive innovations, through an optimized interface system and attentive to the modern form of digital interactions. However, as well as promoting the development of the positive type of artificial intelligence, it also embodies the concern about the lack of conceptual traceability of such systems. Necessarily concluding the inclusion of pre-established guiding principles must be required within the structure of such systems to guarantee their correct use and application.

Nowadays, there are different management systems, for instance: quality, environmental, information security, etc. that can be applied over education centers, but to implement all of them is not a guarantee of education quality because the educational process is very complex. However, a few years ago the Quality Management Systems for higher education centers are taking importance especially in Europe and North America, although in Latin America is an unexplored field. Higher education centers quality is a very complex problem because it is difficult to measure the quality since there are a lot of academic processes as enrollment, matriculation, teaching-learning with a lot of stakeholders as students, teachers, authorities even society; in a lot of locations as campuses, buildings, laboratories with different resources. Each process generates a lot of records and documentation. This information has a varied nature and it is present at a structured and no-structured form. In this context, artificial intelligence techniques can help us to analyze and management knowledge. Our work presents a new approach to audit academic information with machine learning and information retrieval. In our experiments, we used information about syllabus, grades, assessments and online content from a Latin American University. We conclude that using artificial intelligence techniques minimize the decision support time, it allows full data analysis instead of a data sample and it finds out patterns never seen in the case study university.

To assess the region's ability to manage water resources, we conducted an unprecedented literature review of over 20 000 multilingual research articles using machine learning and an understanding of the socio-hydrologic landscape. Results reveal that the region's vulnerability to water-related stresses, and drivers such as climate change, is compounded by research blind spots in niche topics (reservoirs and risk assessment) and subregions (Caribbean nations), as well as by its reliance on an individual country (Brazil). A regional bright spot, Brazil, produces well-rounded water-related research, but its regional dominance suggests that funding cuts there would impede scientifically informed water management in the entire region.

Machine-Learning-Based Proteomic Predictive Modeling with Thermally-Challenged Caribbean Reef Corals	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						artificial intelligence; coral reefs; dinoflagellates; global climate change; machine learning; molecular biotechnology; proteomics; temperature	FLORIDA-KEYS; STRESS; FAVEOLATA; RESPONSES	Coral health is currently diagnosed retroactively; colonies are deemed "stressed" upon succumbing to bleaching or disease. Ideally, health inferences would instead be made on a pre-death timescale that would enable, for instance, environmental mitigation that could promote coral resilience. To this end, diverse Caribbean coral (Orbicella faveolata) genotypes of varying resilience to high temperatures along the Florida Reef Tract were exposed herein to elevated temperatures in the laboratory, and a proteomic analysis was taken with a subset of 20 samples via iTRAQ labeling followed by nano-liquid chromatography + mass spectrometry; 46 host coral and 40 Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellate proteins passed all stringent quality control criteria, and the partial proteomes of biopsies of (1) healthy controls, (2) sub-lethally stressed samples, and (3) actively bleaching corals differed significantly from one another. The proteomic data were then used to train predictive models of coral colony bleaching susceptibility, and both generalized regression and machine-learning-based neural networks were capable of accurately forecasting the bleaching susceptibility of coral samples based on their protein signatures. Successful future testing of the predictive power of these models in situ could establish the capacity to proactively monitor coral health.

This is a field that generates results that amplify and extend to political communication, such as microsegmentation or automated diffusion of content; likewise, it produces some adverse effects that hinder citizen participation in the cybersphere. This paper presents a review of works published in three Latin American countries (Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico) with artificial intelligence, communication, and democracy as their constituent elements. The data come from a total of 206 documents, including reports from supranational organisms and associations, and publications in scientific journals indexed in databases such as Google Scholar and Scopus between 2011 and 2021. The selection criterion is based on the total or partial appearance of certain keywords, plus filters by relevance and impact factors. This systematic review is structured based along four axes that explain democracy according to Landman et al. (2009): electoral participation, participation of civil society, media integrity, and impartial administration. The main conclusions indicate that many of the practices in the studied countries are still at an incipient or experimental stage, with algorithmic political communication being used especially during electoral campaigns. Similarly, an increasing resistance from civil society to the influence of social networks is starting to be detected.

Our goal was to conduct a comprehensive survey of neurosurgeons to assess the acceptance of and attitudes toward ML in neurosurgical practice and to identify factors associated with its use. Methods The online survey consisted of nine or ten mandatory questions and was distributed in February and March 2019 through the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) and the Congress of Neurosurgeons (CNS). Results Out of 7280 neurosurgeons who received the survey, we received 362 responses, with a response rate of 5%, mainly in Europe and North America. In total, 103 neurosurgeons (28.5%) reported using ML in their clinical practice, and 31.1% in research. Adoption rates of ML were relatively evenly distributed, with 25.6% for North America, 30.9% for Europe, 33.3% for Latin America and the Middle East, 44.4% for Asia and Pacific and 100% for Africa with only two responses. No predictors of clinical ML use were identified, although academic settings and subspecialties neuro-oncology, functional, trauma and epilepsy predicted use of ML in research. The most common applications were for predicting outcomes and complications, as well as interpretation of imaging. Conclusions This report provides a global overview of the neurosurgical applications of ML. A relevant proportion of the surveyed neurosurgeons reported clinical experience with ML algorithms. Future studies should aim to clarify the role and potential benefits of ML in neurosurgery and to reconcile these potential advantages with bioethical considerations.

Research design and methods We analyzed 13 population-based national surveys in nine countries (n=8361). We used k-means to develop a clustering model; predictors were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), and T2DM family history. The training data set included all surveys, and the clusters were then predicted in each country-year data set. We used Euclidean distance, elbow and silhouette plots to select the optimal number of clusters and described each cluster according to the underlying predictors (mean and proportions). Results The optimal number of clusters was 4. Cluster 0 grouped more men and those with the highest mean SBP/DBP. Cluster 1 had the highest mean BMI and WC, as well as the largest proportion of T2DM family history. We observed the smallest values of all predictors in cluster 2. Cluster 3 had the highest mean age. When we reflected the four clusters in each country-year data set, a different distribution was observed. For example, cluster 3 was the most frequent in the training data set, and so it was in 7 out of 13 other country-year data sets. Conclusions Using unsupervised machine learning algorithms, it was possible to cluster people with T2DM from the general population in LAC; clusters showed unique profiles that could be used to identify the underlying characteristics of the T2DM population in LAC.

A TALE ABOUT PROMISING TECHNOLOGIES AND APOCALYPTIC ROBOTS	ATHENEA DIGITAL			English	Article						Latin America; Artificial Intelligence; Robots; Frankenstein; Ethics of science	SCIENCE; AI	Frankenstein is not an exclusive character belonging to the realm of the Gothic narrative, but a vivid element that has evolved and adapted to diverse social contexts and geographies. Mary Shelley's work has endured the passing of time and now is a symbol of the popular culture. In this paper, I look to understand Mary Shelley's Frankenstein influence on people's attitudes regarding technology and science, particularly artificial intelligence and robots. How the negative visions and fears about the misuse of science to break traditional moral and religious boundaries are still present in popular culture. Fieldwork will be focused on reviewing several Latin American newspapers and magazine articles in Spanish and Portuguese published on the Internet. As final outcomes will show, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein still continues influencing people's imagination about science and technology, even in technically less developed regions.

This study compares seven ML methods to predict warfarin dosing in Caribbean Hispanics. This is a secondary analysis of genetic and non-genetic clinical data from 190 cardiovascular Hispanic patients. Seven ML algorithms were applied to the data. Data was divided into 80 and 20% to be used as training and test sets. ML algorithms were trained with the training set to obtain the models. Model performance was determined by computing the corresponding mean absolute error (MAE) and % patients whose predicted optimal dose were within +/- 20% of the actual stabilization dose, and then compared between groups of patients with "normal" (i.e., > 21 but <49 mg/week), low (i.e., <= 21 mg/week, "sensitive"), and high (i.e., >= 49 mg/week, "resistant") dose requirements. Random forest regression (RFR) significantly outperform all other methods, with a MAE of 4.73 mg/week and 80.56% of cases within +/- 20% of the actual stabilization dose. Among those with "normal" dose requirements, RFR performance is also better than the rest of models (MAE = 2.91 mg/week). In the "sensitive" group, support vector regression (SVR) shows superiority over the others with lower MAE of 4.79 mg/week. Finally, multivariate adaptive splines (MARS) shows the best performance in the resistant group (MAE = 7.22 mg/week) and 66.7% of predictions within +/- 20%. Models generated by using RFR, MARS, and SVR algorithms showed significantly better predictions of weekly warfarin dosing in the studied cohorts than other algorithms. Better performance of the ML models for patients with "normal," "sensitive," and "resistant" to warfarin were obtained when compared to other populations and previous statistical models.

Latin American and Caribbean countries are struggling to respond to increasing morbidity and death from advanced disease. Health ministries and health-care systems in these countries face many challenges caring for patients with advanced cancer: inadequate funding; inequitable distribution of resources and services; inadequate numbers, training, and distribution of health-care personnel and equipment; lack of adequate care for many populations based on socioeconomic, geographic, ethnic, and other factors; and current systems geared toward the needs of wealthy, urban minorities at a cost to the entire population. This burgeoning cancer problem threatens to cause widespread suffering and economic peril to the countries of Latin America. Prompt and deliberate actions must be taken to avoid this scenario. Increasing efforts towards prevention of cancer and avoidance of advanced, stage IV disease will reduce suffering and mortality and will make overall cancer care more affordable. We hope the findings of our Commission and our recommendations will inspire Latin American stakeholders to redouble their efforts to address this increasing cancer burden and to prevent it from worsening and threatening their societies.

We consider two applications of artificial intelligence: in the characterization of taxpayers' risk and the robotization of tax audit actions. Very little has been described in the literature on how these technologies coexist with taxpayers' rights, especially in the exercise of their right to defense in administrative and contentious proceedings. The evidence reflects that, although in the countries under study the access to these techniques is not clearly regulated, general principles derived from the fundamental rights declared by each country make it possible to safeguard taxpayers' right to access this information.

Artificial intelligence on the identification of risk groups for osteoporosis, a general review	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Review						Artificial intelligence; Osteoporosis; Fracture; Neural network; Compute-raided detection system	BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; DIAGNOSIS; FRACTURE; WOMEN; ULTRASOUND; PREDICTION	Introduction: The goal of this paper is to present a critical review on the main systems that use artificial intelligence to identify groups at risk for osteoporosis or fractures. The systems considered for this study were those that fulfilled the following requirements: range of coverage in diagnosis, low cost and capability to identify more significant somatic factors. Methods: A bibliographic research was done in the databases, PubMed, IEEExplorer Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (LILACS), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct searching the terms "Neural Network", "Osteoporosis Machine Learning" and "Osteoporosis Neural Network". Studies with titles not directly related to the research topic and older data that reported repeated strategies were excluded. The search was carried out with the descriptors in German, Spanish, French, Italian, Mandarin, Portuguese and English; but only studies written in English were found to meet the established criteria. Articles covering the period 2000-2017 were selected; however, articles prior to this period with great relevance were included in this study. Discussion: Based on the collected research, it was identified that there are several methods in the use of artificial intelligence to help the screening of risk groups of osteoporosis or fractures. However, such systems were limited to a specific ethnic group, gender or age. For future research, new challenges are presented. Conclusions: It is necessary to develop research with the unification of different databases and grouping of the various attributes and clinical factors, in order to reach a greater comprehensiveness in the identification of risk groups of osteoporosis. For this purpose, the use of any predictive tool should be performed in different populations with greater participation of male patients and inclusion of a larger age range for the ones involved. The biggest challenge is to deal with all the data complexity generated by this unification, developing evidence-based standards for the evaluation of the most significant risk factors.

Impact of COVID-19 on electricity demand of Latin America and the Caribbean countries	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS			English	Article						Demand consumption; COVID-19 pandemic; Lockdown; Regression analysis; Clustering; Classification trees	ENERGY	Governments worldwide have adopted different public health measures in order to slow down the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the electricity demand has been impacted by the changes in human activity. Many of the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries have adopted different approaches to control the COVID-19 pandemic, including severe shutdown of most social and economic activities. This paper analyzes how this pandemic has influenced, from its appearance until the fall of 2020, the demand of ten LAC countries (Peru, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay). The approach is based on the concepts of size and shape impacts, which have been proposed in order to decompose the problem for a better understanding of the impact. The size impact accounts for the observed variations on the daily demand, whereas the shape impact focuses on the variations observed on the standardized hourly demand profiles for each day. To calculate both impacts, the observed demand is compared to the expected one if the COVID-19 crisis had not happened. To obtain reliable estimations in the scenario without COVID19, machine learning techniques have been used. Peru and Bolivia are the two countries where the pandemic has had the greatest impact during 2020, with a size impact in April 2020 of around -30%. At the opposite extreme would be Chile and Uruguay, with a maximum monthly size impact of -6%. The other considered countries have maximum monthly impacts in the range of -11% to -17%.

In fact, this data can be used to develop clinical risk prediction tools. We performed a systematic literature review with the objective of analyzing current studies that use artificial intelligence techniques in EHRs data to identify in-hospital falls. We searched several digital libraries for articles that reported on the use of EHRs and artificial intelligence techniques to identify in-hospital falls. Articles were selected by three authors of this work. We compiled information on study design, use of EHR data types, and methods. We identified 21 articles, 11 about fall risk prediction and 10 covering fall detection. EHR data shows opportunities and challenges for fall risk prediction and in-hospital fall detection. There is room for improvement in developing such studies.	[dos Santos, Henrique D.

Particularly, it seeks to identify and compare their attitudes, perceived constraints, and knowledge on the state of the art of the application of AI to professional journalistic practices. In tune with the quantitative turn in contemporary journalism and due to the lack of quantitative measures in this field, this research also develops and psychometrically validates tools for measuring such aspects. The main results reveal the existence of differences in these journalists' attitudes and knowledge with regard to AI that can be attributed to their cultural context. They also show similarities to attitudes of journalists from Northern countries to AI. This research fills in the gap in the existing literature on journalism, AI, journalists' attitudes, Global South and LA journalism.

Maintaining the continuity and quality of electricity supply implies the need for models that can represent the dynamics of the electric power systems in order to provide tools for the study of dynamics, both in situations of contingencies and demand changes, as in normal operation. This work seeks to determine whether the behavior of sets of coherent bars can provide information on the stability of the electric power system.

Optimization of the Hydrothermal Power Systems Operation Planning Based on Artificial Intelligence Techniques	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Optimization; Planning; Hydrothermal Power; Artificial Intelligence		Hydrothermal Power Systems Operation Planning (HPSOP) aims to define the generation strategy for each individual power plant which represents the minimal overall operational cost along the planning period. This is a challenge for the energy sector managers, because it is a large stochastic optimization problem, coupled in time (dynamic) and in space (interconnected). The objective function is nonlinear, not convex and inseparable. Classical techniques present difficulties to solve the HPSOP problem due to its complexity. Thus, improvements in the traditional techniques of nonlinear optimization or the development of alternative ones are essential to the HPSOP. This paper presents two artificial intelligence techniques: Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms. Both techniques were applied to a test scenario with two hydroelectric power plants from the Brazilian power system and they have demonstrated good results and performance when compared with the optimization techniques traditionally used for HPSOP. It is valuable to note that the optimization based on artificial intelligence techniques makes use of the actual operational characteristics of the power plants without the simplifications required by the traditional techniques.

Such models can be valuable tools to understand the biogeography of species and to support the prediction of its presence/absence considering a particular environment scenario. This paper investigates the use of different supervised machine learning techniques to model the potential distribution of 35 plant species from Latin America. Each technique was able to extract a different representation of the relations between the environmental conditions and the distribution profile of the species. The experimental results highlight the good performance of random trees classifiers, indicating this particular technique as a promising candidate for modelling species' potential distribution.

Comparative Coastal Risk Index (CCRI): A multidisciplinary risk index for Latin America and the Caribbean	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EXTREME WAVE CLIMATE; VULNERABILITY; CLASSIFICATION; VARIABILITY; MITIGATION; FRAMEWORK; FLOOD	As the world's population grows to a projected 11.2 billion by 2100, the number of people living in low-lying areas exposed to coastal hazards is projected to increase. Critical infrastructure and valuable assets continue to be placed in vulnerable areas, and in recent years, millions of people have been displaced by natural hazards. Impacts from coastal hazards depend on the number of people, value of assets, and presence of critical resources in harm's way. Risks related to natural hazards are determined by a complex interaction between physical hazards, the vulnerability of a society or social-ecological system and its exposure to such hazards. Moreover, these risks are amplified by challenging socioeconomic dynamics, including poorly planned urban development, income inequality, and poverty. This study employs a combination of machine learning clustering techniques (Self Organizing Maps and K-Means) and a spatial index, to assess coastal risks in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) on a comparative scale. The proposed method meets multiple objectives, including the identification of hotspots and key drivers of coastal risk, and the ability to process large-volume multidimensional and multivariate datasets, effectively reducing sixteen variables related to coastal hazards, geographic exposure, and socioeconomic vulnerability, into a single index. Our results demonstrate that in LAC, more than 500,000 people live in areas where coastal hazards, exposure (of people, assets and ecosystems) and poverty converge, creating the ideal conditions for a perfect storm. Hotspot locations of coastal risk, identified by the proposed Comparative Coastal Risk Index (CCRI), contain more than 300,00 people and include: El Oro, Ecuador; Sinaloa, Mexico; Usulutan, El Salvador; and Chiapas, Mexico. Our results provide important insights into potential adaptation alternatives that could reduce the impacts of future hazards. Effective adaptation options must not only focus on developing coastal defenses, but also on improving practices and policies related to urban development, agricultural land use, and conservation, as well as ameliorating socioeconomic conditions.

J	Morrison, MI				Morrison, M. Irene			Info-topia: Postcolonial cyberspace and artificial intelligence in TRON: Legacy and Nalo Hopkinson's Midnight Robber	JOURNAL OF POSTCOLONIAL WRITING			English	Article						Utopia; settler colonialism; Afrofuturism; race; artificial intelligence; science fiction		Mainstream science fiction such as Disney's TRON: Legacy (2010) lauds the utopian potential of the Internet/cyberspace and artificial intelligence (AI). This is sometimes tempered with concerns that AI in cyberspace will become too powerful and rebel against its creators - a concern based on fears that world powers will lose control of the globally networked systems of people and machines that they have dominated in the postcolonial era. By contrast, Nalo Hopkinson's postcolonial cyberpunk novel Midnight Robber (2000) views AI and cyberspace through the lens of Afro-Caribbean epistemology. As a consequence, AI becomes less frightening in its potential, cyberspace becomes a space for accounting for the ways information technology is complicit in colonial projects, and technological appropriation provides hope for building a better world.

As consumer preferences in Latin America and the Caribbean evolve, determining what traits best capture regional grain quality preferences is fundamental for breeding and cultivar release. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS), marker-assisted selection (MAS), and genomic selection (GS) were evaluated to help guide the development of new breeding strategies for rice grain quality improvement. For this purpose, 284 rice lines representing over 20 yr of breeding in Latin America and the Caribbean were genotyped and phenotyped for 10 different traits including grain milling, appearance, cooking, and edible quality traits. Genetic correlations among the 10 traits ranged from -0.83 to 0.85. A GWAS identified 19 significant marker/trait combinations associated with eight grain quality traits. Four functional markers, three located in the Waxy and one in the starch synthase IIa genes, were significantly associated with six grain-quality traits. These markers individually explained 51-75% of the phenotypic variance depending on the trait, clearly indicating their potential utility for MAS. Cross-validation studies to evaluate predictive abilities of four different GS models for each of the 10 quality traits were conducted and predictive abilities ranged from 0.3 to 0.72. Overall, the machine learning model random forest had the highest predictive abilities and was especially effective for traits where large effect quantitative trait loci were identified. This study provides the foundation for deploying effective molecular breeding strategies for grain quality in Latin American rice breeding programs.

Since then, world governments have coordinated information flows and issued guidelines to contain the overwhelming effects of this disease. At the same time, the scientific community is continually seeking information about transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of the disease, new diagnoses, and strategies for prevention and treatment. One of the challenges is performing the tests for the diagnosis of the disease, whose technique adopted for the detection of the genetic material of COVID-19 requires equipment and specialized human resources, making it an expensive procedure. We hypothesize that machine learning techniques can be used to classify the test results for COVID-19 through the joint analysis of popular laboratory tests' clinical parameters. Machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines Regression, enable the creation of disease prediction models and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze clinical parameters. Thus, we evaluated the existing correlations between laboratory parameters and the result of the COVID-19 test, and developed two classification models: the first classifies the test results for patients with suspected COVID-19, and the second classifies the hospitalization units of patients with COVID-19, both according to the laboratory parameters. The models achieved an accuracy above 96%, showing that they are promising to the classification of tests for COVID-19 and screen patients by hospitalization unit.	[Oliveira, R. F. A.

This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based preoperative score to predict cardiac surgical operative mortality. METHODS We developed various models to predict cardiac operative mortality using machine learning techniques and compared each model to European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation-II (EuroSCORE-II) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves (ROC AUC and PR AUC) as performance metrics. The model calibration in our population was also reported with all models and in high-risk groups for gradient boosting and EuroSCORE-II. This study is a retrospective cohort based on a prospectively collected database from July 2008 to April 2018 from a single cardiac surgical center in Bogota, Colombia. RESULTS Model comparison consisted of hold-out validation: 80% of the data were used for model training, and the remaining 20% of the data were used to test each model and EuroSCORE-II. Operative mortality was 6.45% in the entire database and 6.59% in the test set. The performance metrics for the best machine learning model, gradient boosting (ROC: 0.755; PR: 0.292), were higher than those of EuroSCORE-II (ROC: 0.716, PR: 0.179), with a P value of .318 for the AUC of the ROC and .137 for the AUC of the PR. CONCLUSIONS The gradient boosting model was more precise than EuroSCORE-II in predicting mortality in our population based on ROC and PR analyses, although the difference was not statistically significant.

However, the use of conventional methods for slum detection such as field surveys can be time-consuming and costly. This paper explores the possibility of implementing a low-cost standardized method for slum detection. We use spectral, texture and structural features extracted from very high spatial resolution imagery as input data and evaluate the capability of three machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest) to classify urban areas as slum or no-slum. Using data from Buenos Aires (Argentina), Medellin (Colombia) and Recife (Brazil), we found that Support Vector Machine with radial basis kernel delivers the best performance (with F2-scores over 0.81). We also found that singularities within cities preclude the use of a unified classification model.

Given their high homicide rate as a consequence of the high crime rate, these countries have been classified among the most violent in the world. According to data reported by the Crime Observatory, the National Police and the Attorney General's Office of Colombia, in 2019 there were 1,032 murders in Bogota. This data shows a homicide rate of 14.3 per 100,000 inhabitants. From this, it is estimated that between 1960 and 2019, around 226,215 homicides were generated, which is, on average, 3,834 deaths per year. In this work a random forest-based machine learning model is presented, which allows predicting violent homicide (VH) trends in Colombia for the next 5 years. The objective of the model is to serve as an instrument to facilitate decision-making in organizations such as the Prosecutor's Office and the National Police. The model was evaluated with a dataset obtained from the Criminal, Contraventional and Operational Statistical Information System (SIEDCO in Spanish) of the Prosecutor's Office, which has 2,662,402 records of crimes committed in Colombia from 1960 to 2019.

Globally, over 314.019.135 confirmed cases and 5.507.370 deaths have been recorded at 12 January 2022, based on the Dashboard updated by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The continuous rise in the number of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic patients has developed efficient and accessible models for prediction using Open Source Libraries and Cloud Services. This paper proposes different machine-learning algorithms to analyse the COVID-19 OpenData Resources from Mexico and Brazil, which represent the two major populations, economics and affected by disease countries in Latin America. This model uses only the COVID-19 patient's geographical, social conditions, economics conditions, clinical risk factors, symptom reports, and demographic data to predict recovery and death. The model of Mexico has an accuracy of 93% and the perceived mean of recall and the precision (F1 Score) of 0.79 on the dataset used. On the other hand, the model of Brazil has an accuracy of 69% and F1 score of 0.75 on the dataset studied. The result considers data from patients under the age of 0 and 120 years. The contribution of the work is the application of Big Data technologies and Machine Learning algorithms using Open Resource Libraries and Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the vision to improve the clinical diagnosis, even infectious disease with mathematical approaches.

These utilities commonly have a problem associated with non-technical energy losses (NTLs) to unidentified energy flows consumed, but not billed in power distribution grids. They are usually due to either the electricity theft carried out by their own customers or failures in the utilities' energy measurement systems. Non-technical energy losses lead to significant economic losses for electric utilities around the world. For instance, in Latin America and the Caribbean countries, NTLs represent around 15% of total energy generated in 2018, varying between 5 and 30% depending on the country because of the strong correlation with social, economic, political, and technical variables. According to this, electric utilities have a strong interest in finding new techniques and methods to mitigate this problem as much as possible. This research presents the results of determining with the precision of the existing data-oriented methods for detecting NTL through a methodology based on data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (multivariate data, analysis methods, classification, grouping algorithms, i.e., k-means and neural networks). The proposed methodology was implemented using the MATLAB computational tool, demonstrating improvements in the probability to identify the suspected customer's measurement systems with error in their records that should be revised to reduce the NTLs in the distribution system and using the information from utilities' databases associated with customer information (customer information system), the distribution grid (geographic information system), and socio-economic data. The proposed methodology was tested and validated in a real situation as a part of a recent Ecuadorian electric project.

This essay analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence to solve existing inequalities in Latin America. Methodology/Approach. The official labor and educational statistics of the United Nations, and the applications of artificial intelligence in Latin America and the Caribbean, were reviewed and analyzed from bioethics and human rights. Results/Findings. Job insecurity is permanent in all reports. In this context, the replacement of activities by artificial intelligence presents a high to medium risk for employment in the private sector. Discussion/Conclusions. The prevailing discourse glorifies the benefits of technology, without considering existing inequalities. However, this instrument of productive transformation must be evaluated by analyzing power relations and its social impact. Education is an insufficient response if it is not integrated into national human development priorities. The implementation of the different forms of digital technology must offer real alternatives for full and secure employment, complying with articles 14 and 16 of the 2005 Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights.

The need to establish more inclusive and sustainable public transport programs has brought larger cities in Latin America to seek new ways to enhance mobility and integration of transport systems. In this paper, we analyze the level of mobility and integration of public transport systems in eight Latin American cities. For each city we applied the mobility integration index introduced by Cohen [1] and Kamargianni [2] considering key factors including ticket and payment integration, use of information and communication technologies (ICT), institutional integration, clean energy transport and mobility packages. The study indicates that Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City and Buenos Aires have made most advances in implementing a more integrated and mobile public transport system, with Sao Paulo, Santiago de Chile and Curitiba showing an intermediate level of integration and Lima and Bogota struggling to achieve higher levels of mobility. While the study indicates that integrated mobility programs are taking off in Latin America, faster development is limited by multiple factors including a lacking vision on inclusive and sustainable public transport, resistance from transport operators, limitations in ICT infrastructure and limited financial resources to embark on mayor mobility programs in the region. Given that this research is limited to a comparison of Latin American cities and to advance with much needed mobility in the region, it is recommended to conduct further research and derive lessons learned from smart cities with more advanced levels of mobility in public transport in Europe or Asia.

MLtool: A Tool to Automate the Construction, Evaluation, and Selection of Machine Learning Models	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Machine Learning; Model Selection; Automatic Algorithm Selection; Automated Machine Learning	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY	The use of Machine Learning has intensified in recent years, gaining notoriety in the most diverse applications. Thus, there is a growing demand for professionals in this area, which has favored the entry of countless inexperienced users in the labor market. The path from the initial step to the use of algorithms and Machine Learning techniques in production environment takes considerable time, even from experts, due to the realization of interactive and manual tasks required for building predictive models that provide the desired results. In view of this, this work presents a tool to automate the construction, evaluation and selection of predictive models considering Machine Learning algorithms and parameters values more appropriate for each situation. The stages of feature selection, standardization, resampling, and training in the construction of models were considered in the tool. The proposed tool deal with the treatment of the problem of data unbalancing, as needed, as well as the execution control of the steps involved in the process of creating predictive models. The results obtained demonstrate that the order and choice of the steps and the values chosen for the algorithm parameters affect the final results of the generated models.

J	Intrator, K; Shivdikar, K				Intrator, Kira; Shivdikar, Kaustubh			Missing 'Middle Scenarios': Uncovering Nuanced Conditions in Latin America's Housing Crisis	CITYSCAPE			English	Article							EXPANSION; CITY	This article proposes a novel approach to capturing housing deficiencies in rapidly urbanizing regions that is more suitable for data capture, policymaking, and redevelopment. Housing deficit data need to be accurately captured and categorized to adequately act on them. As underscored in the New Urban Agenda, urban policymakers need to be able to set accurate and realizable targets to address the housing crisis. Local governments require precise knowledge of ground realities to strategically allocate money and resources, target solutions, and avoid needless waste. Planners and architects require detailed data and plans to respond to complex conditions. Citizens and nongovernmental organizations should be informed of their communities' needs to engage and collaborate in enhancing local urban service delivery. The goal of this article is threefold: (1) to explore a new method to rapidly capture high-quality housing data in the region; (2) to discuss how these deficits and spatial patterns could be clustered into a new form of place-based deficiency typologies; and (3) to contribute to a more precise analysis of housing shortfalls for planners, policymakers, and local governments using the Latin American region as a case-study scenario. The proposed solution has the potential to be lower cost, more accurate, rapid, and scalable compared with currently applied techniques and technologies such as census data and satellite imagery.

Intrusion Detection System Based On Flows Using Machine Learning Algorithms	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						intrusion detection system; netflow; machine learning		The use of technology by different types of devices generates a large flow of confidential and personal information. Referencing this situation, it is necessary to use computer security tools, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This work presents an IDS that can perform the flow-based analysis (netflow). The first step of this research conducted an analysis on flows previously collected and properly detected three different types of attacks. In the second step, the flows were organized to be used in machine learning algorithms.	[Kakihata, E. M.; Sapia, H. M.; Oikawa, R. T.; Pereira, D. R.; Silva, F.

Real-time Transient Stability Assessment of Electric Power Systems using Predictive-SIME based on Machine Learning	2017 IEEE PES INNOVATIVE SMART GRID TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE - LATIN AMERICA (ISGT LATIN AMERICA)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference - Latin America (ISGT Latin America)	SEP 20-22, 2017	Quito, ECUADOR	IEEE		Machine Learning; Monte Carlo; SIME; Support Vector Machine; Transient Stability		This paper presents a novel methodology based on machine learning for assessing the power system transient stability (TS) in real-time using synchronized phasor measurements as input in order to predict the power system TS status related to the single machine equivalent (SIME) results. Based on the probabilistic models of input parameters, such as load variation and the occurrence of contingencies, Monte Carlo-type simulation is performed off-line to iteratively evaluate the system TS responses using the SIME methodology. Afterwards, the database obtained from the off-line simulations is employed for structuring and training an intelligent SIME's TS margin classifier based on support vector machines (SVM) to be used for real-time transient stability assessment (TSA). Besides, the SVM is optimally tuned by using the swarm variant of the mean-variance mapping optimization MVMOS. Several tests are then performed on the New England benchmark power system. Results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness that could be achieved in estimating the transient stability status related to the SIME's TS margins, which will also be of great value for defining suitable emergency control actions in real time.

Integrating Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis Using Machine Learning	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Information Security; Malware; Static Analysis; Dynamic Analysis; Unified Analysis; Machine Learning		Malware Analysis and Classification Systems use static and dynamic techniques, in conjunction with machine learning algorithms, to automate the task of identification and classification of malicious codes. Both techniques have weaknesses that allow the use of analysis evasion techniques, hampering the identification of malwares. In this work, we propose the unification of static and dynamic analysis, as a method of collecting data from malware that decreases the chance of success for such evasion techniques. From the data collected in the analysis phase, we use the C5.0 and Random Forest machine learning algorithms, implemented inside the FA1VIA framework, to perform the identification and classification of malwares into two classes and multiple categories. In our experiments, we showed that the accuracy of the unified analysis achieved an accuracy of 95.75% for the binary classification problem and an accuracy value of 93.02% for the multiple categorization problem. In all experiments, the unified analysis produced better results than those obtained by static and dynamic analyzes isolated.	[Mangialardo, R. J.; Duarte, J.

We do not find strong evidence for or against positive average intent-to-treat effects on household-level outcomes, including indicators of expenditure, calorie and protein intake, diet quality, egg consumption and production, as well as chicken ownership and management. Among girls between the ages of six and sixty months, we find that the program reduced stunting by 23.5 (+/- 19.4) percentage points while also improving other height and weight outcomes. Boys are more likely to suffer from intestinal illness, which could explain differences in program impacts by gender. Using machine learning methods, we show that the poorest households enjoyed the largest impacts on diet quality and animal protein consumption, whereas children in the poorest households experienced the largest impacts on the probability of consuming animal source foods. Larger effects on animal source food consumption among children in relatively poor households did not translate into greater impacts on height or weight.

Modeling Dengue vector population using remotely sensed data and machine learning	ACTA TROPICA			English	Article						Remote sensing; Time series; Machine learning; Dengue population; Aedes irgypti (Linnaeus)	DIFFERENCE WATER INDEX; AEDES-AEGYPTI; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; CORDOBA CITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DYNAMICS; OUTBREAK; VALIDATION; PREDICTION	Mosquitoes are vectors of many human diseases. In particular, Aedes cegypti (Linnaeus) is the main vector for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Latin America and it represents a global threat. Public health policies that aim at combating this vector require dependable and timely information, which is usually expensive to obtain with field campaigns. For this reason, several efforts have been done to use remote sensing due to its reduced cost. The present work includes the temporal modeling of the oviposition activity (measured weekly on 50 ovitraps in a north Argentinean city) of Aedes cegypti (Linnaeus), based on time series of data extracted from operational earth observation satellite images. We use are NDVI, NDWI, LST night, LST day and TRMM-GPM rain from 2012 to 2016 as predictive variables. In contrast to previous works which use linear models, we employ Machine Learning techniques using completely accessible open source toolkits. These models have the advantages of being non-parametric and capable of describing nonlinear relationships between variables. Specifically, in addition to two linear approaches, we assess a support vector machine, an artificial neural networks, a K-nearest neighbors and a decision tree regressor. Considerations are made on parameter tuning and the validation and training approach. The results are compared to linear models used in previous works with similar data sets for generating temporal predictive models. These new tools perform better than linear approaches, in particular nearest neighbor regression (KNNR) performs the best. These results provide better alternatives to be implemented operatively on the Argentine geospatial risk system that is running since 2012.

Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Information Security Risk Assessment	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Audits; artificial intelligence; computer security; risk 6		In computer security audits, information security risk (ISR) assessments are performed to computer systems, within it to database management systems (DBMS), often using qualitative methodologies. In these methodologies, the evaluation of the ISR is classified according to its impact in linguistic terms such as: High, Medium or Low, so that ambiguities can be generated in the evaluation result. Security checklists are also used to review the configurations of the DBMS. They have a strong dependence on the presence of the expert auditor in DBMS for this analysis. In order to facilitate the work of the auditors, a model based on knowledge and fuzzy logic was developed for the evaluation of the ISR in the DBMS. In this way, the experience in previous audits of this type is useful and improves the results in the evaluation of the ISR.	[Basallo, Y. A.; Senti, V. E.; Sanchez, N.

This radiation is the primary energy source of conversion in photovoltaic plants and solar thermal power plants. The incident radiation is not constant and depends on climatic data, which results in an intermittency in its behavior and changes in the production of electrical energy are observed. This justifies the development of a tool for predicting and estimating incident radiation in order to foresee changes in the performance of photovoltaic generation systems. This paper presents an analysis and review of the literature published in the Science Direct and IEEE databases since 1990, from the point of view of techniques application for the estimation of the primary solar resource. These techniques are classified according to the nature of the model from numerical and analytical approaches to Machine Learning. These approaches use different databases, inputs and mathematical relationships to establish dependencies among solar radiation, longitude, latitude and climatic parameters. In this paper, the selection criteria and behavior of the models are identified from the linearity treatment of the database to be used, the number of entries, the deviation between the value that is predicted and the test portion of the set of data that evaluate their behavior and provide decision tools for their use. Many authors apply Machine Learning to estimation both with unitary predictors and with hybrid models that profit from their potential.

Method: ADHD severity was derived using latent class cluster analysis of DSM-IV symptomatology. Family-based association tests were conducted to detect associations between SNPs and ADHD severity latent phenotypes. Machine learning algorithms were used to build predictive models of ADHD severity based on demographic and genetic data. Results: Individuals with ADHD exhibited two seemingly independent latent class severity configurations. SNPs harbored in DRD4, SNAP25, and ADGRL3 showed evidence of linkage and association to symptoms severity and a potential pleiotropic effect on distinct domains of ADHD severity. Predictive models discriminate severe from non-severe ADHD in specific symptom domains. Conclusion: This study supports the role of DRD4, SNAP25, and ADGRL3 genes in outlining ADHD severity, and a new prediction framework with potential clinical use.

However, after excluding data collected under non-optimal observing conditions such as strong sun glint, clouds, thick aerosols, straylight, and large viewing angles, only similar to 5% of MODIS ocean measurements lead to valid Chl retrievals, regardless of the fact that about 25-30% of the global ocean is cloud free. A recently developed ocean color index (CI) is effective in deriving relative ocean color patterns under most non-optimal observing conditions to improve coverage, but these patterns cannot be interpreted as Chl. In this study, we combine the advantage of the high-quality, low-coverage Chl and lower-quality, higher-coverage CI to improve spatial and temporal coverage of Chl through machine learning, specifically via a random forest based regression ensemble (RFRE) approach. For every MODIS scene, the machine learning requires CI, Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc (lambda = 469, 555, 645 nm), dimensionless), and high-quality low-coverage Chl from the common pixels where they all have valid data to develop an RFRE-based model to convert CI and R-rc (lambda) to Chl. The model is then applied to all valid CI pixels of the same scene to derive Chl. This process is repeated for each scene, and the model parameterization is optimized for each scene independently. The approach has been tested for the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (YSECS) where non-optima) observing conditions frequently occur. Validations using extensive field measurements and image-based statistics for 2017 show very promising results, where coverage in the new Chl maps is increased by similar to 3.5 times without noticeable degradation in quality as compared with the original Chl data products. The improvement in Chl coverage without compromising data quality is not only critical in revealing otherwise unknown bloom patterns, but also important in reducing uncertainties in time series analysis. Tests of the RFRE approach for several other regions such as the East Caribbean, Arabian Sea, and Gulf of Mexico suggest its general applicability in improving Chl coverage of other regions.

This is currently a focus of interest among public and private organizations, governments, research institutes and companies operating in diverse fields as health, security, commercial recommendations, detection of anomalies and future trends among others. In this problem, the main objective is to recognize and extract meaningful information (patterns, structure, underlying relationships, etc.) from huge amounts of heterogeneous data. This task is complicated by new, significant storage and processing requirements due to unprecedented volumes of data. In this scenario, new algorithms in Pattern Recognition and related fields are being devised, while well known techniques are revisited and adapted to these new challenges. Latin American research in the "Big Data" problem is still incipient, but there is a significant body of recent works in the subjects of Pattern Recognition and related fields that indirectly addresses the problem. This paper reviews Latin American contributions in Pattern Recognition and related fields in the last lustrum. The focus is set on-but not restricted to-applications in the fields of Computer Vision and Image Analysis with large scale characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With increasing uncertainty in healthcare, existing unmet needs such as poor outcomes of lung cancer (LC) patients in LMICs, mainly due to late stages at diagnosis, have been challenging-necessitating a shift in focus for judicious health resource utilization. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for screening large volumes of pulmonary images performed for noncancerous reasons, such as health checks, immigration, tuberculosis screening, or other lung conditions, including but not limited to COVID-19, can facilitate easy and early identification of incidental pulmonary nodules (IPNs), which otherwise could have been missed. AI can review every chest X-ray or computed tomography scan through a trained pair of eyes, thus strengthening the infrastructure and enhancing capabilities of manpower for interpreting images in LMICs for streamlining accurate and early identification of IPNs. AI can be a catalyst for driving LC screening with enhanced efficiency, particularly in primary care settings, for timely referral and adequate management of coincidental IPN. AI can facilitate shift in the stage of LC diagnosis for improving survival, thus fostering optimal health-resource utilization and sustainable healthcare systems resilient to crisis. This article highlights the challenges for organized LC screening in LMICs and describes unique opportunities for leveraging AI. We present pilot initiatives from Asia, Latin America, and Russia illustratingAl-supported IPN identification from routine imaging to facilitate early diagnosis of LC at a potentially curable stage.

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) allow detecting anomalies and attacks in real time, by analyzing the local and outgoing traffic of the network. At present, to improve its performance, it has been chosen to use Machine Learning (ML) techniques that automate these processes and improve the detection of an anomaly. This paper implements ML techniques through the use of datasets, in the context of a NIDS, for the detection and prediction of anomalies on networks. Tests were performed with non-supervised and supervised learning algorithms on NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets. An exploratory analysis of data together with dimensionality reduction techniques allowed us to understand the nature of the data, prior to the modeling. The results show that the methodology can be extrapolated for real scenarios with different network configurations.

The proposed diagnostic method uses both signal processing techniques and machine learning techniques in order to detect and localize the switch under an open-circuit fault. First, the Hilbert-Huang transform using the empirical ensemble mode decomposition is employed for each phase current signal, which leads to extracting the intrinsic mode functions. In order to optimally choose the function indicating the open-circuit fault harmonic, two factors, namely, the root mean square and the correlation coefficient are calculated out for each function. In this regard, two criteria are proposed that lead to choose the optimal function giving better information about the defected phase. The spectral envelope of the optimal function permits extra0cting the fault harmonic of the switch. Second, different machine learning techniques are applied to locate and classify the switch open-circuit faults with the hyper-parameters optimization for a better design of the different models. Finally, a comparative study of the different machine learning techniques is carried out for determining the best classifier for the open-circuit faults. The experimental results effectively demonstrate a very high classification rate of 98.98%.

In grocery retailing, an OOS event is used to characterize the condition in which customers do not find a certain commodity while attempting to buy it. This paper focuses on addressing this problem from a manufacturer's perspective, conducting a case study in a retail packaged foods manufacturing company located in Latin America. We developed two machine learning based systems to detect OOS events automatically. The first is based on a single Random Forest classifier with balanced data, and the second is an ensemble of six different classification algorithms. We used transactional data from the manufacturer information system and physical audits. The novelty of this work is our use of new predictor variables of OOS events. The system was successfully implemented and tested in a retail packaged foods manufacturer company. By incorporating the new predictive variables in our Random Forest and Ensemble classifier, we were able to improve their system's predictive power. In particular, the Random Forest classifier presented the best performance in a real-world setting, achieving a detection precision of 72% and identifying 68% of the total OOS events. Finally, the incorporation of our new predictor variables allowed us to improve the performance of the Random Forest by 0.24 points in the F-measure.

These alerts signal an increase in respiratory diseases among the population. For this reason, this paper designs a preventive early alert system for air quality. This system compares three machine learning models and validates, through statistical and categorical parameters (9), that a stochastic model, combined with a convolution bidirectional recurrent neural network (1D-BDLM), has an accuracy of approximate to 93 +/- 4% when forecasting the risk for each population group in all the monitoring stations. Likewise, it is also able to capture high pollution events without producing false alarms (approximate to 10 +/- 5%). This model is utilized to design an alert protocol (24 h in advance) before a pollution event occurs. The protocol distinguishes the level of alert and the type of population at risk, focusing on two objectives: pollution mitigation and risk reduction for the population. To reduce pollutant concentrations, this paper proposes limiting vehicle traffic in the most polluted city zones or, if necessary, throughout the entire area. In relation to stationary sources, this article proposes the implementation of monitoring measures in order to identify the most polluting factories and restrict their operation during a specific period of time. In regards to population risk, the protocol aims to reduce exposure time by recommending the avoidance of outdoor activities (in specific zones) and the use of protective gear, taking into consideration relevant differences between population groups.

Tourism brought Bonaire economic growth but also puts pressure on the island's natural ecosystem. Previous studies on tourist interest based on surveys are labour-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. This paper explores whether the use of freely available social media data combined with automatic machine learning methods can function as a cheap and fast alternative to surveys. From 2003 to 2019, 13,706 geotagged Flickr data points assigned keywords, then weighted using TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency), and finally clustered with DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Noise Applications). Two factors determine whether a cluster has an associated unique activity/interest: the most relevant and least relevant keywords. Eight identified clusters are useful for interpreting Bonaire tourists' interest: urban tourism; nature tourism around the lake; in-land natural tourism; conch shell and food; unique fishes; windsurf activity; cruise and ship; carnival, parade and singing. Tourism demand was forecasted using both Flickr and CBS (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek) data. Flickr data could show which continent the tourist came from in which seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) from 2015 to the end of 2021.

That is why the present research work, aimed to comparatively analyze the academic performance of Latin America in the PISA 2018 Assessment, with emphasis on the performance of Peruvian students. Through a process of documentary analysis, the results from 10 Latin American countries that are part of the OECD were studied, in which adolescents between 15 and 16 years old were evaluated. The results showed that some countries, despite being in the best positions in Latin America, showed a downward trend in terms of academic performance, and countries such as Peru, were showing upward trends, despite still being in low positions in the world ranking.

However, difficulties are still encountered by managers in adequately assessing sustainability at the corporate level. In this perspective, data mining and machine learning are presented as techniques for extracting potentially useful information for generation of knowledge. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to identify, by means of a literature review, different approaches used to assist in the evaluation of sustainable performance. The method called Methodi Ordinatio was used for the review and, for the analysis, the software tools: VOSviewer e RStudio. By means of the methodological procedure adopted, 33 significant articles were identified for analysis from the Web of Science, Scopus and Science Direct databases, in which mainly the applied techniques were addressed. In this sense, this study seeks to stimulate research on the use of DM and ML to help in the sustainable context, being essential to assist in the Sustainable Development Goals.

The coherency in power systems refers to the property of the elements of these systems present in the time domain responses similar during the occurrence of a transient in these systems. The work presented here seeks to determine whether the behavior of sets of coherent bars can provide information on the stability of the electric power system. The major contribution of this paper is to present a methodology based on the use of artificial intelligence, that regardless of the accuracy of the modeling and the parameters commonly adopted to represent the electric power system, allows to obtain information on their current behavior as well as short-term prediction of their future behavior.

However, products of these processes fail to be satisfactory in most cases. This is due primarily to non-linear behavior that correlates different variables to be considered. This article presents a methodology to train surrogate models based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) using limited experimental data. Polynomial, Gaussian, and exponential radial basis function kernels were used for modeling. It has been proved that assembling the best models in a new one can surpass some of these individually. Several indicators were used to measure the model performance. An absolute relative error of 16% was reported during the use of the best ones. SVM offers a simple and reliable way in modeling the behavior of soils and can greatly enhance the capacity in soil mechanics laboratories in Latin America.

Nowadays, there are several remote sensing techniques that can be used as a source to derive bathymetry data along coastal areas. The key techniques are: sonar (sound navigating and ranging), LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and high-resolution satellite images. The present paper describes a method which was developed and used to create a shallow water bathymetry data along the Dutch side of Sint Maarten Island by combining sonar measurements and satellite images in a nonlinear machine learning technique. The purpose of this work is to develop a bathymetry dataset that can be used to set up physically-based models for coastal flood modelling work. The nonlinear machine learning technique used in the work is a support vector machine (SVM) model. The sonar data were used as an output whereas image data were used as an input into the SVM model. The results were analysed for three depth ranges and the findings are promising. It remains to further verify the capacity of the new method on a dataset with higher resolution satellite imagery.

Corona Effect Detection in Energized Polymeric Insulators Using Machine Learning and Ultrasonic Emissions	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						artificial neural network; machine learning; multilayer perceptron; support vector machines; polymeric insulator; ultrasound; corona; monitoring; diagnostics	NETWORKS	The occurrence of corona effect is an important indication that an insulator probably has malfunction. Thus, the corona detection can help to diagnose problems in insulators, which might cause serious damage to the power distribution system, such as the sudden interruption of service. Machine learning techniques are used to classifying patterns into categories. This paper evaluated the application of MLP (multilayer perceptron) and SVM (support vector machines) for corona detection in high voltage polymeric insulators using ultrasonic emissions. To perform the capture of these data, a specific electronic circuit was developed in order to capture the ultrasonic signals tuned in the 40 kHz. The results indicate that both methods offer high generalizability and looks to be promising techniques for this type of problem, using ultrasonic frequencies as the data source.	[da Silva Junior, E.

It is mandatory to understand the epilepsy's underlying etiology, whether it is structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune or (currently) unknown, as it contains major information about the clinical phenotype, cognitive comorbidities, (new) drug targets and also help to predict postsurgical outcome. A multimodal approach, including digital slides and multichannel immunofluorescence labelling can increase the diagnostic yield of subtle pathologies, while DNA methylation arrays could helps in the diagnosis of difficult-toclassify lesions. Such techniques are not always available, however, in low-income countries. Even without access to expensive molecular techniques, automated analysis scripts and machine learning algorithms can be developed by Latin American researchers to improve our diagnostic yield from routine Hematoxylin & Eosin stained tissue sections. The pathology community of Latin America contributed substantially to our current knowledge of etiologies related to human epilepsies and experimental epilepsy models. To further boost the impact of Latin American research, local centers should adhere to modern, multimodal neuropathology techniques, integrate different levels of knowledge, and strengthen their scientific collaborations. Dedicated teaching courses in Epileptology, such as the Latin American Summer Schools of Epilepsy (LASSE) or International Summer School for Neuropathology and Epilepsy Surgery (INES) addressing young researcher and neurologists, are most successful to promote this endeavor. In this review, we will describe the state of neuropathology at the 21st century and also highlight Latin American researchers' contributions to the current knowledge in neuropathology of epilepsy.

These endeavors are especially critical in the case of chronic conditions, such as diabetes. Recent developments in machine learning have been successful at predicting readmissions from the medical history of the diabetic patient. However, these approaches rely on a large number of clinical variables thereby requiring deep learning techniques. This article presents the application of simpler machine learning models achieving superior prediction performance while making computations more tractable.

Considering the relevance of monitoring water quality, and knowing that field evaluation is a time-consuming and costly procedure, the use of satellite images, widely available at low cost, emerges as a relevant alternative. This work proposes a systematic experimental evaluation of five machine learning methods - Extra Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, under different configurations and input data treatments, to classify the turbidity of the Paraopeba River waters from Sentinel-2 mission images. In a classification setup defined from Brazilian legislation turbidity classes, all methods obtained results equal to or greater than 0.87 accuracy, with appropriate settings and data treatments. The best result was obtained using the Support Vector Machine classifier with hyperparameters adjustment by random search, input data processed by the Yeo-Johnson transformation and selection of spectral bands by collinearity analysis. In this case, the accuracy was 0.96 with two classes, and 0.91 with 3 classes, indicating the feasibility of using this method to classify turbidity.

Aim: it was hypothesized that anticipating an infectious disease diagnosis by a few days could significantly improve a patient's well-being and reduce the burden on emergency health system services. Methods: vital signs from residents were taken daily and transferred to a database in the cloud. Classifiers were used to recognize patterns in the spatial domain process of the collected data. Doctors reported their diagnoses when any disease presented. A flexible microservice architecture provided access and functionality to the system. Results: combining two different domains, health and technology, is not easy, but the results are encouraging. The classifiers reported good results; the system has been well accepted by medical personnel and is proving to be cost-effective and a good solution to service disadvantaged areas. In this context, this research found the importance of certain clinical variables in the identification of infectious diseases. Conclusions: this work explores how to apply mobile communications, cloud services, and machine learning technology, in order to provide efficient tools for medical staff in nursing homes. The scalable architecture can be extended to big data applications that may extract valuable knowledge patterns for medical research.

We investigated spatial patterns of forest loss in South Korea and assessed the effects of various factors on forest loss based on spatial heterogeneity. We used the local Moran's I to classify forest loss spatial patterns as high-high clusters, low-low clusters, high-low outliers, and high-low outliers. Additionally, to assess the effect of factors on forest loss, two statistical models (i.e., ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models) and one machine-learning model (i.e., random forest (RF) model) were used. The accuracy of each model was determined using the R-2, RMSE, MAE, and AICc. Across South Korea, the forest loss rate was highest in the Seoul-Incheon-Gyeonggi region. Moreover, high-high spatial clusters were found in the Seoul-Incheon-Gyeonggi and Daejeon-Chungnam regions. Among the models, the GWR model was the most accurate. Notably, according to the GWR model, the main factors driving forest loss were road density, cropland area, number of households, and number of tertiary industry establishments. However, the factors driving forest loss had varying degrees of influence depending on the location. Therefore, our findings suggest that spatial heterogeneity should be considered when developing policies to reduce forest loss.

Predicting Long-Term Wind Speed in Wind Farms of Northeast Brazil: A Comparative Analysis Through Machine Learning Models	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Long-Term; Machine Learning; Northeastern Brazil; Regression; Wind Power; Wind Speed Forecasting	ERROR	The rapid growth of wind generation in northeast Brazil has led to multiple benefits to many different stakeholders of energy industry, especially because the wind is a renewable resource - an abundant and ubiquitous power source present in almost every state in the northeast region of Brazil. Despite the several benefits of wind power, forecasting the wind speed becomes a challenging task in practice, as it is highly volatile over time, especially when one has to deal with long-term predictions. Therefore, this paper focuses on applying different Machine Learning strategies such as Random Forest, Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting to perform regression on wind data for long periods of time. Three wind farms in the northeast Brazil have been investigated, whose data sets were constructed from the wind farms data collections and the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET). Statistical analyses of the wind data and the optimization of the trained predictors were conducted, as well as several quantitative assessments of the obtained forecast results.

Spanish is considered a second language in indigenous communities and is progressively introduced in education. However, most of the tools to support teaching processes of a second language have been developed for the most common languages such as English, French, German, Italian, etc. As a result, only a small amount of learning objects and authoring tools have been developed for indigenous people considering the specific needs of this population. This paper introduces Multilingual-Tiny as a web authoring tool to support the virtual experience of indigenous students and teachers when they are creating learning objects in indigenous languages or in Spanish language, in particular, when they have to deal with grammatical structures of Spanish language. Multilingual-Tiny has a module based on the Case-based Reasoning technique to provide recommendations in real time when teachers and students write texts in Spanish.

Automatic Mapping Magnetic Resonance Images into Multimedia Database Using SIFT	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Artificial Intelligence; Ontology; Multimedia Database; Pattern Recognition; Magnetic Resonance		This paper focuses on the representation of magnetic resonances of different parts of the human body, such as knees, spinal column, arms, elbows, etc., using ontologies. First, it maps the resonance images in a multimedia database. Then, automatically, using the SIFT pattern recognition algorithm, descriptors of the images stored in the database are extracted in order to recover useful data for the user; it uses the ontologies as an artificial intelligence tool and, in consequence, reduces generation of useless data. Why do we think this is an interesting task? Because, if the user requires information about any topics or (s) he has some illness or needs to undergo magnetic resonance, this tool will show him/her images and text to convey a better understanding, helping to obtain useful conclusions. Artificial intelligence techniques are used, such as machine learning, knowledge representation, and pattern recognition. The ontological relations introduced here are based on the common representation of language, using definition dictionaries, Roget's thesaurus, synonym dictionaries, and other resources The system generates an output in the OM ontological language [1]. This language represents a structure where our system adds the data scanned by the SIFT algorithm. The tests have been made in Spanish; however, thanks to the portability of our system, it is possible to extend the method to any language.	[Reynoso, J. L.; Cuevas, A.

A growing trend is the construction of artificial intelligence software to execute tasks without human intervention, such as collecting and presenting information to users, making a reservation at a restaurant on a special date, and generally carrying out tasks related to customer service by automated bots for solving to solve everyday situations, normally employees in the messaging through the development of advanced conversational interfaces. The bots with the ability to simulate conversations through conversational interfaces are already a reality and their boom is increasing. A field where they have a prominent presence has to do with customer service. This paper presents the components designed and developed of a bot used by a company in the financial sector consolidated for more than a decade in Latin America to manage customer service in order to solve everyday situations.

Cryptographic Algorithm Identification Using Machine Learning and Massive Processing	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Cryptographic algorithm identification; Data mining; Machine intelligence; Parallel computing		This paper presents a study on encryption algorithms identification by means of machine learning techniques. Plain text files, written in seven different languages, were encoded by seven cryptographic algorithm under ECB mode. The resulting cryptograms were submitted to a transformation so that it was possible to create metadata files. These files provide information for six data mining algorithms in order to identify the cryptographic algorithm used for encryption. The identification performance was evaluated and the language influence at the procedure was analyzed. The overall experiment involves many cryptograms, a great quantity of metadata, a huge time consuming computation, and therefore, it was employed a high performance computer. The successful identification for each mining algorithm is greater than a probabilistic bid, and there are several scenarios where algorithm identification reaches almost full recognition.

We visited three Latin American countries and observed use of the Middle School Mathematics Tutor in a school in each country. We found that students in these classrooms tended to work more collaboratively than observed students in the United States, in particular engaging in more interdependently-paced work and conducting work away from their own computer. We discuss how cognitive tutors might be improved to be more adaptive to these environments.

With the increase in the share of solar photovoltaic systems, the impact of power fluctuations in these sources has worsened, which can affect the quality of electrical energy and the reliability of the electrical power system. Therefore, with the use of energy storage together with control algorithms based on artificial intelligence, it is possible to control and perform power smoothing. In this context, the study presents a technical feasibility study on the use of artificial neural network (ANN) to perform the power smoothing of the photovoltaic system connected to the network. Being studied the performance of a real photovoltaic system operating in conjunction with an ideal energy storage for comparative analysis of the performance of the artificial neural network when the numbers of neurons and layers are modified for different real operating conditions considered as temperature variation, humidity, irradiation, pressure and wind speed, which are considered to be ANN input data. The results obtained point to the feasibility of using ANN, with acceptable precision, for power smoothing. According to the analyzes carried out, it is clear that ANN's with few neurons, the smoothing profile tends to be more accurate when compared to larger amounts of neurons. In the current state of the study, it was not possible to determine a relationship between the variations in the number of neurons with the most accurate results, it is important to note that the development of the curve pointed by the neural network can be influenced by the database. It should be noted that, when ANN exceeds or does not reach the optimal smoothing curve, the storage system compensates for the lack or excess of power, and there is a need for other mechanisms to optimize power smoothing.

Currently, the gold standard for assessing fracture risk is measurement of areal bone mineral density with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Several ultrasound techniques, such as Bi-Directional Axial Transmission (BDAT) have been presented as alternatives. For the first studies, classification between fractured and non fractured patients was based on classical ultrasonic parameters, such as velocities or cortical thickness and porosity, obtained from an inverse problem. Recently, novel parameters obtained from structural analysis guided wave spectrum images (GWSI) have been introduced. The aim of this study is to merge both points of view and explore which parameters are the most important to obtain a robust classification using a machine learning approach. This study uses the same set of patients used in previous studies with 195 patients associated with 8 ultrasonic parameters and 3 clinical factors (age BMI and cortisone intake). In addition, each patient corresponds to 10 GWSI, from which 32 parameters of structural analysis are extracted per image, leading to a total of 43 features per image. The dataset was divided into 70% of patients (n = 136) as training and 30% as testing (n = 59). The distribution of patients was adjusted for age and target class. The accuracy was calculated for an increased number of features, which ranking was obtained using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). The highest accuracy of 71% is obtained with the optimized parameters and a combination between 22 and 25 features. These result, comparable to femoral DXA (AUC = 0.71, adjusted linear regression), opens perspective towards robust detection of patients at risk of fracture with ultrasound.

TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article							TECHNOLOGY; TASKS; EMPLOYMENT	The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which comprises digitization, artificial intelligence, robotics, among others, have the power to drastically increase economic output but may also displace workers. In this paper we assess the risk of automation for female and male workers in four Latin American countries - Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and El Salvador. Our study is the first to apply a task-based approach with a gender perspective in this region. Our main findings indicate that men are more likely than women to perform tasks linked to the 'skills of the future', such as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), information and communications technology, management and communication, and creative problem-solving tasks. Women thus have a higher average risk of automation, and 21% of women vs. 19% of men are at high risk (probability of automation greater than 70%). The differential impacts of the new technological trends for women and men must be assessed in order to guide the policy-making process to prepare workers for the future. Finally, country- level specific actions should be taken to prevent digital transformation from worsening existing gender inequalities in the labor market.

Chikungunya outbreak (2015) in the Colombian Caribbean: Latent classes and gender differences in virus infection	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							ROSS-RIVER-VIRUS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; CELLULAR ASPECTS; EPIDEMIC; DISEASE; ARTHRITIS; FEVER	Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, is part of a group of emergent diseases, including arbovirus, constituting an increasing public health problem in tropical areas worldwide. CHIKV causes a severe and debilitating disease with high morbidity. The first Colombian autochthonous case was reported in the Colombian Caribbean region in September 2014. Within the next two to three months, the CHIKV outbreak reached its peak. Although the CHIKV pattern of clinical symptomatology has been documented in different epidemiological studies, understanding of the relationship between clinical symptomatology and variation in phenotypic response to CHIKV infection in humans remains limited. We performed a cross sectional study following 1160 individuals clinically diagnosed with CHIKV at the peak of the Chikungunya outbreak in the Colombian Caribbean region. We examined the relationship between symptomatology and diverse phenotypic responses. Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) models were used to characterize patients' symptomatology and further identify subgroups of individuals with differential phenotypic response. We found that most individuals presented fever (94.4%), headache (73.28%) and general discomfort (59.4%), which are distinct clinical symptoms of a viral infection. Furthermore, 11/26 (43.2%) of the categorized symptoms were more frequent in women than in men. LCCA disclosed seven distinctive phenotypic response profiles in this population of CHIKV infected individuals. Interestingly, 282 (24.3%) individuals exhibited a lower symptomatic "extreme" phenotype and 74 (6.4%) patients were within the severe complex "extreme" phenotype. Although clinical symptomatology may be diverse, there are distinct symptoms or group of symptoms that can be correlated with differential phenotypic response and perhaps susceptibility to CHIKV infection, especially in the female population. This suggests that, comparatively to men, women are a CHIKV at-risk population. Further study is needed to validate these results and determine whether the distinct LCCA profiles are a result of the immune response or a mixture of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Our findings could contribute to the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations. Preliminary results show that the accuracy reached of some approaches reaches up to 92% overall, with substantial sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values per LCCA-derived cluster. Author summary The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is a mosquito-borne virus of the Togaviridae family, part of the arbovirus group of mosquito-transmitted pathogens. CHIKV causes a severe and debilitating disease with high morbidity. In this study, we comprehensively analysed clinical data from 1160 individuals from the Colombian Caribbean, who were diagnosed with CHIKV infection during the 2014 epidemic peak and before the Zika epidemic (registered back in 2015). Further, the presence of latent classes and predictors of CHIKV susceptibility and severity of the CHIKV infection were analysed. Although it is well known that people respond differently to infection, our results showed that these differences are not arbitrary and may come from the specific orchestration of our immune response and specific genetic makeup. For example, we identified that females infected with CHIKV exhibited significant and heterogeneous phenotypic response patterns compared to men. Overall, these results inform about potential predictors and outlining strategies to study the natural history of CHIKV infection. Future studies assessing the contribution of demographic, immunological and genetic factors to symptom co-occurrence could shed some light on the severity of the clinical symptomatology and, ultimately, lead to more accurate, more efficient and differential diagnosis. These results could contribute to the development of machine learning approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations and provide more accurate and differential diagnosis.

During the strike, both methods showed a large reduction in the concentrations of NO2 (31.5-32.36%) and CO (15.55-19.85%) and a slight reduction for O-3 and SO2. The GBM approach showed an exclusive potential, especially for a lengthier period of predictions, to estimate strike impact on air quality even after the strike was over. This advocates for the use of machine learning techniques to estimate an extended effect of changes in human activities on urban gaseous pollution.

The current therapy for Chagas disease is limited to nifurtimox and benznidazole, which are effective in treating only the acute phase of the disease but with severe side effects. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new drugs and for the exploration of innovative approaches which may lead to the discovery of new effective and safe drugs for its treatment. Areas covered: The authors report and discuss recent approaches including structure-based design that have led to the discovery of new promising small molecule candidates for Chagas disease which affect prime targets that intervene in the sterol pathway of T. cruzi. Other trypanosome targets, phenotypic screening, the use of artificial intelligence and the challenges with Chagas disease drug discovery are also discussed. Expert opinion: The application of recent scientific innovations to the field of Chagas disease have led to the discovery of new promising drug candidates for Chagas disease. Phenotypic screening brought new hits and opportunities for drug discovery. Artificial intelligence also has the potential to accelerate drug discovery in Chagas disease and further research into this is warranted.

Modeling Workplace Evacuation Behaviors Using Intelligent Agents	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Artificial Intelligence; Computational Modeling; LCS; Autonomous Agents		A major challenge in artificial intelligence has been the development of autonomous agents (AAs) capable of displaying believable behaviors. To achieve such objective, the underlying architectures of these intelligent systems have been designed to incorporate Learning Classifier System that provides an adaptation naturally with the environment. It is expected that through the interaction of this type of components, AAs can implement more intelligent and believable behavior. Although the literature reports several computational models of behaviors, attention, and emotions developed to be included in cognitive agent architectures, these have been implemented as separated processes, disregarding essential interactions between these behaviors whose modeling and computational implementation may increase the believability of actions developed by AAs. In this paper, we propose an evolutive computational model. This model is designed to provide AAs with adequate mechanisms to attend and react to conditions and changes in the environment.	[Ramos, M.

This study aimed to develop a prognostic score for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients with AKI (AKI-COV score). This was a cross-sectional multicentre prospective cohort study in the Latin America AKI COVID-19 Registry. A total of 870 COVID-19 patients with AKI defined according to the KDIGO were included between 1 May 2020 and 31 December 2020. We evaluated four categories of predictor variables that were available at the time of the diagnosis of AKI: (1) demographic data; (2) comorbidities and conditions at admission; (3) laboratory exams within 24 h; and (4) characteristics and causes of AKI. We used a machine learning approach to fit models in the training set using tenfold cross-validation and validated the accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The coefficients of the best model (Elastic Net) were used to build the predictive AKI-COV score. The AKI-COV score had an AUC-ROC of 0.823 (95% CI 0.761-0.885) in the validation cohort. The use of the AKI-COV score may assist healthcare workers in identifying hospitalized COVID-19 patients with AKI that may require more intensive monitoring and can be used for resource allocation.

This perspective, smart grids have many challenges in its design and development. For example, the creation of algorithms that will be used to replicate the features of these networks where, to perform some decision-making, to collect data in a distributed way is mandatory. This paper proposes a computational model for resolution of problems as mentioned. The text suggest the use of a hybrid algorithm, combining multiagent systems and optimization heuristic methods to simulate decision making in smart grids. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed method, some tests were performed to solve the electric power distribution management problem by switch reconfiguration. The simulation considered the smart grids characteristics of distributed processing, communication, and automation.

The scarce and outdated information on the urban territory impedes the adequate classification of urban areas, limiting the form of its intervention. The purpose of this research was the adoption of unassisted and mixed methods for the spatial classification of urban areas, considering the speculative land value, the proportion of urbanized land, and other geospatial variables. Among the data collection media. Multi-Spectral Imagery (MSI) from the Sentinel-2 satellite. the primary road system, and a sample of direct observation points, were used. The processed data were incorporated into georeferenced maps, to which urban limits and official slopes were added. During data processing, the K-Means algorithm was used. together with other machine learning and assisted judgment methods. As a result, an objective classification of urban areas was obtained, which differs from the existing planning.

If risk stratification for readmission of HF patients could be carried out at the time of discharge from the index hospitalization, corresponding appropriate post-discharge interventions could be arranged to avoid potential readmission. We, therefore, sought to explore and compare two newer machine learning methods of risk prediction using 56 predictors from electronic health records data of 1778 unique HF patients from 31 hospitals across the United States. We used two approaches boosted trees and spike-and-slab regression for analysis and found that boosted trees provided better predictive results (AUC: 0.719) as compared to spike-and-slab regression (AUC: 0.621) in our dataset.

To meet market demands in present and future global industrial world, manufacturing enterprises of any kind and any size must be flexible and agile enough to respond quickly to product demand changes. With support of artificial intelligence and modern information technology it is possible to realise modern cost-effective customer-driven design and manufacturing taking into account the importance and basic role of quality management and metrology. This will be especially possible on the basis of the innovative concept and model for modern enterprises the so-called "Multi-Functions Integrated Factory - MFIF" that makes possible an agile and optimal industrial production in any kind of industry and especially in up-to-date SMEs.

The Wavelet function Daubichies4 is used as base function in detection and identification because of its frequency response and information time localization properties. Based on these patterns, power quality disturbances are automatically classified by using several artificial intelligent techniques: back propagation neural network (multilayer perceptron), kohonen neural network (self organizing map), Bayesian (linear statistical method) and support vector machines (SVM). Neural networks and SVM exhibit the best performance as classifiers (90 percent of success for the most disturbances) in spite of similitude between some disturbance patterns. The whole strategy was integrated on a MatLab(R) Graphical User Interface and tested by using synthetic signals (according to international standards) which were collected in a disturbance database.

In this way, companies classified as Small Cap appear as a great opportunity for significative profitability given the higher volatility. In this scenario, studies aiming to explain the behavior of the stock market are becoming even more important. This article aims to develop prediction models for the Small Cap Index in order to assess whether the series under study can be explained by economic and financial variables. The monthly data used were collected from October 2005 to December 2019. The methods applied for the development of predictive models were multiple linear regression and the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network with backpropagation supervised learning algorithm. For the first forecasting method, the model presents, based on 10 predicting variables, approximately 91% of the explanatory capacity of the Small Cap Index variability, against approximately 98% of the second method, which is based on 16 variables for the forecast. Although the artificial neural network presents better prediction results, both models are satisfactory to explain the behavior of the index under study.

The risk assessment determines the likelihood of something going wrong in a distribution network through the failure probability metric. To deal with the massive variety of information required in the calculation of failure probability we propose a data mining approach. The proposed approach incorporates weather, asset and outage information for characterizing the risk in a distribution network section via GIS platform.

Objectives: To develop and validate a machine learning-guided algorithm which uses a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) for STEMI detection to speed diagnosis. Methods: Data was extracted from the Latin America Telemedicine Infarct Network (LATIN), a population-based Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) program that provides care to patients in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina through telemedicine. Sample: the first dataset was comprised of 8511 ECGs that were used for various machine learning experiments to test our Deep Learning approach for STEMI diagnosis. The second dataset of 2542 confirmed STEMI diagnosis EKG records, including specific ischemic heart wall information (anterior, inferior, and lateral), was derived from the previous dataset to test the STEMI localization model. Preprocessing: Detection of QRS complexes by wavelet system, segmentation of each EKG record into individual heartbeats with fixed window of 0.4 s to the left and 0.9 s to the right of main. Training & Testing: 90% and 10% of the total dataset, respectively, were used for both models. Classification: two 1-D convolutional neural networks were implemented, two classes were considered for first models (STEMI/Not-STEMI) and three classes for the second model (Anterior/Inferior/Lateral) each corresponding to the heart wall affected. These individual probabilities were aggregated to generate the final label for each model. Results: The single-lead ECG strategy was able to provide an accuracy of 90.5% for STEMI detection with Lead V2, which also yielded the best results overall among individual leads. STEMI Localization model provided promising results for anterior and inferior wall STEMIs but remained suboptimal for Lateral STEMI. Conclusions: An Artificial Intelligence-enhanced single-lead ECG is a promising screening tool. This technology provides an autonomous and accurate STEMI diagnostic alternative that can be incorporated into wearable devices, potentially providing patients reliable means to seek treatment early and offers the potential to thereby improve STEMI outcomes in the long run.

Sovereign Debt and Currency Crises Prediction Models Using Machine Learning Techniques	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						sovereign debt crisis prediction; currency crisis prediction; deep learning neural decision trees; fuzzy decision trees; extreme gradient boosting; country reputation	EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; BANKING CRISES; PERFORMANCE; COUNTRIES; INDICATOR; INDUSTRY	Sovereign debt and currencies play an increasingly influential role in the development of any country, given the need to obtain financing and establish international relations. A recurring theme in the literature on financial crises has been the prediction of sovereign debt and currency crises due to their extreme importance in international economic activity. Nevertheless, the limitations of the existing models are related to accuracy and the literature calls for more investigation on the subject and lacks geographic diversity in the samples used. This article presents new models for the prediction of sovereign debt and currency crises, using various computational techniques, which increase their precision. Also, these models present experiences with a wide global sample of the main geographical world zones, such as Africa and the Middle East, Latin America, Asia, Europe, and globally. Our models demonstrate the superiority of computational techniques concerning statistics in terms of the level of precision, which are the best methods for the sovereign debt crisis: fuzzy decision trees, AdaBoost, extreme gradient boosting, and deep learning neural decision trees, and for forecasting the currency crisis: deep learning neural decision trees, extreme gradient boosting, random forests, and deep belief network. Our research has a large and potentially significant impact on the macroeconomic policy adequacy of the countries against the risks arising from financial crises and provides instruments that make it possible to improve the balance in the finance of the countries.

We use machine learning and social network analysis to explore emotions in relation to the public space, based on attributes extracted from photos of the city of Quito, Ecuador, taken between April and June 2020. Our results show that an attribute of the urban landscape can be associated with positive and negative emotions, and that opposite attributes of the images (i.e., glossy and dirty) can both influence positive emotions regarding public space. This research inaugurates a new field of study in Latin America regarding urban emotions, and also supports a better understanding of citizen perceptions of the public space during the pandemic crisis.

We have tackled the question of whether abundant socio-economic data can be harnessed for the purpose of predicting academic outcomes and, thereby, taking proactive actions in student attention, course planning and resource management. A study was conducted to analyze the data gathered by a private university in Ecuador over more than 20 years, to normalize them and to parameterize a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network, whose best-performing configuration would be used as a benchmark for the comparison of more recent and sophisticated Artificial Intelligence techniques. However, an extensive scan of hyperparameters for the perceptron-exploring more than 12,000 configurations-revealed no significant relationships between the input variables and the chosen metrics, suggesting that there is no gain from processing the extensive socio-economic data. This finding contradicts the expectations raised by previous works in the related literature and in some cases highlights important methodological flaws.

Research in this field is a matter of interest for each of the governments to improve education policies. Therefore, the analysis of data on the behavior of a student in an educational institution is of utmost importance, because multiple aspects of progress or student dropout rates during their professional training period can be identified. The most important variables to identify the student's behavior are the socio-economic ones, since the psychological state and the economic deficiencies that the student faces while is studying can be detected. This data provides grades, scholarships, attendance and information on student progress. During the first phase of the study, all the information is analyzed and it is determined which provides relevant data to develop a profile of a student behavior, as well as the pre-processing of the data obtained. In this phase, voracious algorithms are applied for the selection of attributes, such as greedy stepwise, Chi-squared test, Anova, RefiefF, Gain Radio, among others. In this work, we apply the artificial intelligence techniques, the results obtained are compared to generate a normal and unusual behavior of each student according to their professional career. In addition, the most optimal model that has had a higher accuracy percentage, false positive rate, false negative rate and mean squared error in the tests results are determined.

In environments where several decisions have to be made, the MAS is conformed by agents that utilize artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to support real time autonomous operation. This paper presents a proposed application of MAS in electrical substation automation and in distribution automation systems. These automation systems are formed, among other equipment, by the Local Master Station (LMS): the computational system of the substation. The master station executes the control and central processing of the distribution networks or dispatch regional centers. In this kind of environments, multiple collaborative agents achieve their specific goals and cooperate to achieve the system goal. Specific activities carried out by the agents include the acquisition of information, communication transport information, data management and visualization functions. The acquisition is achieved from the substation equipment like remote terminal units (RTUs), meters, protections and relays (IEDs).

Use of Machine Learning to Measure the Influence of Behavioral and Personality Factors on Academic Performance of Higher Education Students	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Academic performance; behavioral and personality factors; clustering; machine learning	PREDICTIVE MODEL; ALGORITHMS; TIME	Quality of education and improvement of school achievement has been linked to students' cognitive, behavioral and personality trait factors. Several researchers have investigated the correlation between these factors and students' academic performance. Particularly, it is assumed that behavioral and personality factors, such as study habits and self-esteem, have a positive and high relationship with students' academic achievement. However, research studies have shown a weak and inconsistent linear correlation level. Hence, research about better representation methods is needed. In this article we present and discuss the results from two studies on the influence of study habits and self-esteem on the academic performance of 153 college freshman students. First, we analyzed the linear correlation between our target variables; similar to previous work, we found a weak positive correlation between academic performance and study habits (r=0.283) and self-esteem (r=0.214). In addition, multiple linear regression was used to explain the relationship between these variables; it was found that the independent variables only explain the academic performance in 6.18%. Second, we propose to use K-means, an unsupervised clustering algorithm, as a better method to explain the influence of behavioral and personality factors and students' academic performance. Through the use of this method: 1) a predictive model of the academic performance is proposed, 2) it was achieved a better representation about the influence among the target variables, and 3) a set of students' academic profiles was created: low, medium and high. We found that 80% of the students with a high level of self-esteem and study habits (high academic profile) obtained a good or outstanding academic performance; outperforming students within the medium and low academic profiles by a significantly margin.

In this paper, we provide an overview of how these techniques can improve nursing care, and we detail a quantitative model to afford managerial insights about care management in a Hospital in Colombia. Our main purpose is to provide tools to improve key performance indicators for the care management of inpatients which includes the nurse workload. Methods The optimal nurse-to-patient assignment problem is addressed using analytics, lean health care, and AI. Also, we propose a new mathematical model to optimize the nurse-to-patient assignment decisions considering several variables about the patient state such as the Barthel index, their risks, the complexity of the care, and the mental state. Findings Our results show that there are several processes inherent to compassionate nursing care that can be improved using technology. By using data analytics, we can also provide insights about the high variability of the care requirements and, by using models, find nurse-to-patient assignments that are nearly perfectly balanced. Conclusions We illustrated this improvement with a pilot test that makes the equitable distribution of nursing workload the functionality of this strategy. The findings can be useful in highly complex hospitals in Latin America. Clinical Relevance The proposed model presents an opportunity to make near perfectly balanced nurse-to-patient assignments according to the number of patients and their health conditions using technology.

Artificial intelligence techniques that can be used in this problem are reviewed here based on the available information. The final objective is to rind the root cause of avalanches of alarms (failure tree) and to reduce their number through grouping or clustering techniques so that the EEMUA 191 standards are followed. Even though other contributions in this topic have been made before, the alarm management problem continues to be practically unsolved for many applications in industry. Here, the integration is developed using the ontology of each system domains, i.e., the ontology corresponding to the alarms, controls, events, energy flow and trigger sequence. Additionally, in this methodology, a rule based expert system is used to treat the alarms with a neural net based approach to treat the historical database of alarms and failures.

Students' Attention Monitoring System in Learning Environments based on Artificial Intelligence	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Monitoring; Manuals; COVID-19; Multitasking; IEEE transactions; Deep learning; Computational modeling; Early warning system; Learning environment; LSTM; Monitoring; Students' attention	RECOGNITION	The students' attention level to the explanation of a given lecture is a factor that might determine the capability of retention and subsequent application of a learned concept. For this reason, students that pay attention are generally more participatory in the learning/teaching process than those who don't, and consequently, they succeed in reaching the competencies proposed in the courses. Hence, it is important to design strategies and tools that help teachers to monitor in a non-invasive way the attention level of the students, allowing them to take actions to modify the dynamics of the lectures when needed. In this work, we introduce a fully automated system to monitor the students' attention based on computer vision algorithms. To this end, we feed a recurrent neural network with one-second sequences generated by facial landmarks. This spatiotemporal analysis of video recordings allows for identifying when a student is attending a given explanation in online educational environments. The system is tested in a database with more than 3000 sequences of students who pay or no attention to online video lectures. Obtained results show that the proposed system is suitable to monitor the students' attention to a particular explanation.

However, AP is less understood from a spatial perspective. The aim of this study was to investigate a methodology using a machine learning approach to determine which answers from a questionnaire-based survey were relevant for explaining the high AP of secondary school students across urban-rural gradients in Ecuador. We used high school locations to construct individual datasets and stratify them according to the AP scores. Using the Boruta algorithm and backward elimination, we identified the best predictors, classified them using random forest, and mapped the AP classification probabilities. We summarized these results as frequent answers observed for each natural region in Ecuador and used their probability outputs to formulate hypotheses with respect to the urban-rural gradient derived from annual maps of impervious surfaces. Our approach resulted in a cartographic analysis of AP probabilities with overall accuracies around 0.83-0.84% and Kappa values of 0.65-0.67%. High AP was primarily related to answers regarding the academic environment and cognitive skills. These identified answers varied depending on the region, which allowed for different interpretations of the driving factors of AP in Ecuador. A rural-to-urban transition ranging 8-17 years was found to be the timespan correlated with achievement of high AP.

To avoid these difficulties this paper suggests a prototype constructed with Artificial Intelligence, through Artificial Neural Nets, used to develop a system with which the student can interact during his learning. The program has computer treated real images to substitute body parts and the user can point, given signals and symptoms, which areas of the organs are their cause. The constructed prototype is directed to the spinal cord and an Artificial Neural Net is developed with patterns obtained in normal Neuroanatomy books with an expert help. The user is presented, at each interaction, to a random set of signals and symptoms and then he is urged to indicate in a displayed image, which parts of the organ could be damaged. Tests with medicine students using this dynamically conducted software had good results, showing that adequate systems could replace the usual methods or be used in cooperation with them, diminishing the related problems.

The explanations consist of meaningful features to the user, namely contextual features. We instantiate our approach in the scenario of automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis and analyze the explanations generated in terms of interpretability and robustness. The proposed method uses a noise-insertion strategy to quantify the impact of intervals and segments of the ECG signals on the automated classification outcome. These intervals and segments and their impact on the diagnosis are common place to cardiologists, and their usage in explanations enables a better understanding of the outcomes and also the identification of sources of mistakes. The proposed method is particularly effective and useful for modern deep learning models that take raw data as input. We demonstrate our method by explaining diagnoses generated by a deep convolutional neural network.	[Oliveira, Derick M.; Ribeiro, Antonio H.; Pedrosa, Joao A. O.; Paixao, Gabriela M.

Liver fibrosis or liver steatosis are often observed accompanying liver diseases. Currently, transient elastography is often used as a non-invasive tool to assess liver health but the corresponding equipment is comparatively complex and expensive. In this work, we provide preliminary results showing how one-dimensional ultrasound radio-frequency signals can be used for the non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis and liver steatosis by deploying various Machine Learning algorithms. We show that a SVM model performing on Wavelet transformed ultrasound radio-frequency signals yields the best performance for fibrosis stage assessments (with an average F-1 score of 85.71 %) and steatosis stage assessments (with an average average F-1 score of 80.95 %).

There are still several obstacles to overcome for the purpose of improving assisted reproductive success, such as intra- and inter-observer subjectivity in embryonic selection, high occurrence of multiple pregnancies, maternal and neonatal complications. Here, we compare studies that used several variables that impact the success of assisted reproduction, such as blastocyst morphology and morphokinetic aspects of embryo development as well as characteristics of the patients submitted to assisted reproduction, in order to predict embryo quality, implantation or live birth. Thereby, we emphasize the proposal of an artificial intelligence-based platform for a more objective method to predict live birth.

J	Salas-Pilco, SZ; Yang, YQ; Zhang, Z				Salas-Pilco, Sdenka Zobeida; Yang, Yuqin; Zhang, Zhe			Student engagement in online learning in Latin American higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						affective engagement; behavioural engagement; cognitive engagement; higher education; Latin America; online learning; student engagement; systematic review	UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; DISTANCE; HEALTH; ICT; SATISFACTION; RELIABILITY; PERCEPTION; CHALLENGES; STRATEGY; SCIENCE	The COVID-19 pandemic has forced higher education institutions to implement online learning activities based on virtual platforms, allowing little time to prepare and train faculty members to familiarize students with digital technologies. While previous studies have looked at how students engaged with digital technologies in their learning activities, the characteristics of the student engagement in online learning remain underexplored. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on student engagement in online learning in higher education is much needed. This article synthesizes the findings on student engagement in Latin American higher education institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the studies on online learning activities, this review examines student engagement from behavioural, cognitive and affective dimensions and identifies the main characteristics of student engagement from these tripartite dimensions. The implications of the findings for online learning in Latin American higher education are as follows: (a) to transform higher education, (b) to provide adequate professional training, (c) to improve Internet connectivity, (d) to ensure quality online learning in higher education and (e) to provide emotional support. These findings will provide valuable guidance for teachers, educational authorities and policy makers and help them make informed decisions to use effective strategies to support online learning in higher education institutions. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the normal operation of higher education institutions across Latin America, impelling a shift from face-to-face instruction to online teaching and learning. Research on online learning in Latin American higher education has been conducted, but the findings and their implications are yet to be widely disseminated among researchers, practitioners and decision-makers. What this paper adds Providing a systematic review of research on student engagement in online learning in Latin American higher education institutions. Analyzing the construct of student engagement in online learning from tripartite dimensions-behavioral, cognitive and affective-in the Latin American higher education context. Identifying the characteristics associated to each dimension of student engagement in online learning. Implications for practice and/or policy The need to transform the higher education system in Latin America and beyond, at two levels: to improve Internet connectivity at the technological level and to ensure the quality of online education at the pedagogical level. The urgency to offer an adequate professional training regarding the use of new technologies in online learning environments. The significance for higher education institutions to provide emotional support for students during the COVID-10 pandemic.

To take advantage of this new market, major content producers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have emerged focusing on video streaming services. However, despite the large number and diversity of videos made available by these content providers, few of them attract most users' attention. For example, in the data explored in this paper, only 6% of the most popular videos are responsible for 85% of the total views. Finding out in advance which videos will be popular is not trivial, specially because of the large amount of influencing variables. Nevertheless, a tool with this ability would be of great value to help dimensioning network infrastructure and to properly recommend new content to users. In this work, we propose two approaches to obtaining features to classify the popularity of a video before it is published. The first one builds upon predictive attributes defined by feature engineering. The second leverages word embeddings from the descriptions and titles of the videos. We experiment with the proposed approaches on a set of videos from GloboPlay, the largest provider of video streaming services in Latin America. A combination of both engineered features and the embeddings using Random Forest machine learning algorithm reached the best result, with an accuracy of 87%.

Outsourcing this computation to the cloud requires the server to be trusted, introducing a non-realistic security assumption and high risk of abuse or data breaches. In this paper, we propose privacy-preserving versions of the k-NN classifier which operate over encrypted data, combining order-preserving encryption and homomorphic encryption. According to our experiments, the privacy-preserving variant achieves the same accuracy as the conventional k-NN classifier, but considerably impacts the original performance. However, the performance penalty is still viable for practical use in sensitive applications when the additional security properties provided by the approach are considered. In particular, the cloud server does not need to be trusted beyond correct execution of the protocol and computes the algorithm over encrypted data and encrypted classes. As a result, the cloud server never learns the real dataset values, the number of classes, the query vectors or their classification.	[Pereira, Hilder V.

The author has used statistical and soft computing methods to program the prediction models. It compares the effectiveness of twelve different early warning models for forecasting the bankruptcy risk of companies. In the research conducted, the author used data on 185 companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and 60 companies listed on Stock Exchange markets in Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Chile. This population of firms was divided into learning and testing setdata. Each company was analyzed using the absolute values of 14 financial ratios and the dynamics of change of these ratios. The author's developed models are characterized by high efficiency. These studies are one of the world's first attempts at comparing differences in forecasting this phenomenon between the regions of Latin America and Central Europe. Additionally, a comparison of the effectiveness of discriminant analysis, decisional trees, and artificial neural networks models was made. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many of these parameters are linked to the storage pressure (P) and temperature (T) of the erupted magma, and the chemistry of the melt phase (X). However, reliable single-phase thermobarometers (P, T) and chemometers (X) which can recover this information remain elusive. We present a suite of new single-phase amphibole and clinopyroxene thermobarometers and chemometers, calibrated using random forest machine learning. These calibrations are used to track the range of pre-eruptive conditions, over the course of a millennial eruptive cycle, on an island arc volcano (Mount Liamuiga, Saint Kitts, Eastern Caribbean). We unpick the recent history of Mount Liamuiga, a stratovolcano that produces a dacitic eruption from the upper crust (similar to 2 kbar) prior to the Lower Mansion Series eruptive sequence. This precedes a systematic increase in the temperature of crystallisation recovered by amphibole and clinopyroxene in the middle to upper crust (1.2 +/- 0.5 to 5.6 +/- 2.4 kbar), which correlates with a remarkable progression of matrix plagioclase chemistry to a less-evolved (more anorthitic) composition in time. Prediction of melt chemistry (SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, Na2O, K2O, FeO, MgO, TiO2) in equilibrium with clinopyroxene and amphibole delineate a liquid line of descent concordant with measured groundmass and whole rock chemistry. We also show that the regression strategy, as opposed to the abject insensitivity to pressure, has hindered previous calibrations of amphibole-only barometers. By applying our new calibrations, we construct a quantitative picture of the magma plumbing system beneath an arc volcano.

In recent years seasonal diseases caused by vectors that transport viral pathogens in tropical regions, such as the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, have caused noticeable impacts both on public health and country's economies in Latin America. This work proposes a model for early prognosis based on FCMs for making a risk assessment of potential presence of seasonal virus-related diseases in a specific region of the Ecuadorian coast. The FCM is used as a knowledge representation strategy for the cause-effect relationships; and, learning models for gaining the identification of the underlying cause of symptoms.

Nevertheless, several barriers preclude the development of a systematic "ConnEEGtome" in dementia research. Here we review critical sources of variability in EEG connectivity studies, and provide general guidelines for multicentric protocol harmonization. We describe how results can be impacted by the choice for data acquisition, and signal processing workflows. The implementation of a particular processing pipeline is conditional upon assumptions made by researchers about the nature of EEG. Due to these assumptions, EEG connectivity metrics are typically applicable to restricted scenarios, e.g., to a particular neurocognitive disorder. "Ground truths" for the choice of processing workflow and connectivity analysis are impractical. Consequently, efforts should be directed to harmonizing experimental procedures, data acquisition, and the first steps of the preprocessing pipeline. Conducting multiple analyses of the same data and a proper integration of the results need to be considered in additional processing steps. Furthermore, instead of using a single connectivity measure, using a composite metric combining different connectivity measures brings a powerful strategy to scale up the replicability of multicentric EEG connectivity studies. These composite metrics can boost the predictive strength of diagnostic tools for dementia. Moreover, the implementation of multi-feature machine learning classification systems that include EEG-based connectivity analyses may help to exploit the potential of multicentric studies combining clinical-cognitive, molecular, genetics, and neuroimaging data towards a multi-dimensional characterization of the dementia.

Sean			Land cover and forest formation distributions for St. Kitts, Nevis, St. Eustatius, Grenada and Barbados from decision tree classification of cloud-cleared satellite imagery	CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE			English	Article						vegetation map; land-use change; Landsat; Caribbean; forest conservation; machine learning; multidate	THEMATIC MAPPER DATA; SUCCESSIONAL STAGE; REGRESSION TREES; BIODIVERSITY	Satellite image-based mapping of tropical forests is vital to conservation planning. Standard methods for automated image classification, however, limit classification detail in complex tropical landscapes. In this study, we test an approach to Landsat image interpretation on four islands of the Lesser Antilles, including Grenada and St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Eustatius, testing a more detailed classification than earlier work in the latter three islands. Secondly, we estimate the extents of land cover and protected forest by formation for five islands and ask how land cover has changed over the second half of the 20(th) century. The image interpretation approach combines image mosaics and ancillary geographic data, classifying the resulting set of raster data with decision tree software. Cloud-free image mosaics for one or two seasons were created by applying regression tree normalization to scene dates that could fill cloudy areas in a base scene. Such mosaics are also known as cloud-filled, cloud-minimized or cloud-cleared imagery, mosaics, or composites. The approach accurately distinguished several classes that more standard methods would confuse; the seamless mosaics aided reference data collection; and the multiseason imagery allowed us to separate drought deciduous forests and woodlands from semi-deciduous ones. Cultivated land areas declined 60 to 100 percent from about 1945 to 2000 on several islands. Meanwhile, forest cover has increased 50 to 950%. This trend will likely continue where sugar cane cultivation has dominated. Like the island of Puerto Rico, most higher-elevation forest formations are protected in formal or informal reserves. Also similarly, lowland forests, which are drier forest types on these islands, are not well represented in reserves. Former cultivated lands in lowland areas could provide lands for new reserves of drier forest types. The land-use history of these islands may provide insight for planners in countries currently considering lowland forest clearing for agriculture.

Selection of Asymmetrical Transformers Banks with Emphasis in Losses and Efficiency	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Operational efficiency; asymmetrical transformers bank; artificial intelligence		In many power distribution systems when three-phases and single-phase loads are combined is common to use asymmetrical transformers banks. Although different connections can be used, the most usual for mixes loads, is the wye/delta-grounded three elements transformer bank where one of the transformers, the one with the higher capacity, is called the lighting transformer and the other two power transformers. The lighting transformer in the secondary side is grounded and also supplies the single-phase loads. In rural and low load systems the open-delta and open-wye connections are frequently used. This paper show an optimization process based on artificial intelligence technique; genetic algorithm, to determinate the most adequate capacity of each transformers of the asymmetrical bank based on losses and life cycle cost reduction. The goal is to increase the efficiency and reduce cost of power transformers banks operating in field conditions. This article exposed as a study case a transformer bank supplying Cienfuegos's University in Cuba. The procedure can be applied to other transformers configuration as well as to three phase power transformers. The result obtained show increased efficiency and reduced cost of the Cienfuegos's installation.	[de Armas, M.

Tele-electrocardiography and bigdata: The CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography) study	JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY			English	Article						Electrocardiography; Telehealth; Big-data; Artificial intelligence	MINAS-GERAIS; STATE	Digital electrocardiographs are now widely available and a large number of digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recorded and stored. The present study describes the development and clinical applications of a large database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided using heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients <16 years-old, 1,558,415 patients were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1 scores >80% and specificity >99% in an independent test dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed by a large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the field of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.

J	Clemente, L; Lu, F; Santillana, M				Clemente, Leonardo; Lu, Fred; Santillana, Mauricio			Improved Real-Time Influenza Surveillance: Using Internet Search Data in Eight Latin American Countries	JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE			English	Article						google flu trends; influenza monitoring; real-time disease surveillance; digital epidemiology; influenza; human; developing countries; machine learning	FLU	Background: Novel influenza surveillance systems that leverage Internet-based real-time data sources including Internet search frequencies, social-network information, and crowd-sourced flu surveillance tools have shown improved accuracy over the past few years in data-rich countries like the United States. These systems not only track flu activity accurately, but they also report flu estimates a week or more ahead of the publication of reports produced by healthcare-based systems, such as those implemented and managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Previous work has shown that the predictive capabilities of novel flu surveillance systems, like Google Flu Trends (GFT), in developing countries in Latin America have not yet delivered acceptable flu estimates. Objective: The aim of this study was to show that recent methodological improvements on the use of Internet search engine information to track diseases can lead to improved retrospective flu estimates in multiple countries in Latin America. Methods: A machine learning-based methodology that uses flu-related Internet search activity and historical information to monitor flu activity, named ARGO (AutoRegression with Google search), was extended to generate flu predictions for 8 Latin American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay) for the time period: January 2012 to December of 2016. These retrospective (out-of-sample) Influenza activity predictions were compared with historically observed flu suspected cases in each country, as reported by Flunet, an influenza surveillance database maintained by the World Health Organization. For a baseline comparison, retrospective (out-of-sample) flu estimates were produced for the same time period using autoregressive models that only leverage historical flu activity information. Results: Our results show that ARGO-like models' predictive power outperform autoregressive models in 6 out of 8 countries in the 2012-2016 time period. Moreover, ARGO significantly improves on historical flu estimates produced by the now discontinued GFT for the time period of 2012-2015, where GFT information is publicly available. Conclusions: We demonstrate here that a self-correcting machine learning method, leveraging Internet-based disease-related search activity and historical flu trends, has the potential to produce reliable and timely flu estimates in multiple Latin American countries. This methodology may prove helpful to local public health officials who design and implement interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of influenza outbreaks. Our methodology generally outperforms both the now-discontinued tool GFT, and autoregressive methodologies that exploit only historical flu activity to produce future disease estimates.

Analysis of incidence of air quality on human health: a case study on the relationship between pollutant concentrations and respiratory diseases in Kennedy, Bogota	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Geostatistics; Machine learning; Sustainable development; Air quality; Hot spots	PM2.5 CONCENTRATIONS; REGRESSION; POPULATION; PROXIMITY; ASTHMA; IMPACT; MODEL; PM10	Thousands of deaths associated with air pollution each year could be prevented by forecasting the behavior of factors that pose risks to people's health and their geographical distribution. Proximity to pollution sources, degree of urbanization, and population density are some of the factors whose spatial distribution enables the identification of possible influence on the presence of respiratory diseases (RD). Currently, Bogota is among the cities with the poorest air quality in Latin America. Specifically, the locality of Kennedy is one of the zones in the city with the highest recorded concentration levels of local pollutants over the last 10 years. From 2009 to 2016, there were 8619 deaths associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in the locality. Given these characteristics, this study set out to identify and analyze the areas in which the primary socioeconomic and environmental conditions contribute to the presence of symptoms associated with RD. To this end, information collected in field by performing georeferenced surveys was analyzed through geostatistical and machine learning tools which carried out cluster and pattern analyses. Random forests and AdaBoost were applied to establish hot spots where RD could occur, given the conjugation of predictor variables in the micro-territory. It was found that random forests outperformed AdaBoost with 0.63 AUC. In particular, this study's approach applies to densely populated municipalities with high levels of air pollution. In using these tools, municipalities can anticipate environmental health situations and reduce the cost of respiratory disease treatments.

The volcanic-related disasters alter the living conditions of the populations compromised by their activity. We propose to use Recursive Density Estimation (RDE) method to detect volcanic anomalies. The different data used for the design and evaluation of this method are obtained from Purace volcano of two surveillance volcanic areas: Geochemistry and Deformation. The proposed method learns quickly from data streams in real time and the different volcanic anomalies can be detected taking into account all the previous data of the volcano. RDE achieves good performance in the outliers detection; 82% of precision for geochemestry data, while 77% of precision in geodesy data.

Machine Learning Model for Predicting Evaporation Losses in Reservoirs	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Evaporation losses; Prediction; Support Vector Regression; Correlation		This paper presents a modification in method Support Vector Regression applied in the prediction of evaporation losses in reservoirs. For this approach, a penalty constant was included in the training phase (adjustment) and in the test phase of the SVR method, being called a method correlated with SVR. For training and testing, the predictive variables are the mean temperature (degrees C), the average wind speed (m/s), sunshine hours (h/day) and the average relative humidity (%). However, the output variable was the evaporation value (mm/day). The data used correspond to the Manasgaon water reservoir, reservoir located in Anand Sagar, Shegaon, India. The evaluation took into account the error values and the correlation coefficient as a comparison criterion. In the end, the results were compared with the values obtained by the conventional SVR method and by artificial neural networks, obtained smaller values for the error if it were more efficient for this application.

J	Simchi-Levi, D; Wu, MX				Simchi-Levi, David; Wu, Michelle Xiao			Powering retailers' digitization through analytics and automation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						analytics; machine learning; price theory; online retail; forecasting		Retailers face significant pressure to improve revenue, margins and market share by applying price optimisation models. These are mathematical models that calculate how demand varies at different price levels, then combine that data with information on costs and inventory levels to recommend prices that will improve revenue and profits. These models have been around for a while-so what is different now? We have identified three important changes: (1) Data: availability of internal and external real-time data such as traffic to a website, consumers making buy/no buy decisions and competitor pricing strategies; (2) Analytics: advances in machine learning and ease of access (R, Python) have enabled the development of systems that learn on the fly about consumer behaviour and preferences and generate effective estimates of demand-price relationships; and (3) Automation: increase in computing speed enables real-time optimisation of prices of hundreds of competing products sold by the same retailer. We take advantage of these new opportunities by showing how they were applied at Boston-based flash sales retailer Rue La La, online market maker Groupon, and the largest online retailer in Latin America, B2W Digital (B2W). While all these examples are of on-line businesses which have readily available data and can change prices dynamically, we have also implemented similar methods for brick-and-mortar retailed in applications such as promotional pricing, new product introduction, and assortment optimisation with similar business impacts. Thus, beyond applications to price optimisations, these new trends enable companies to revolutionise their business from procurement to supply chain all the way to revenue management.

J	Macarayan, EK; Balabanova, D; Gotsadze, G				Macarayan, Erlyn K.; Balabanova, Dina; Gotsadze, George			Assessing the field of health policy and systems research using symposium abstract submissions and machine learning techniques	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Agenda setting; healthcare organizations; health systems research; health policy; international health policy; health inequalities; community		The field of health policy and systems research (HPSR) has grown rapidly in the past decade. Examining recently aggregated data from the Global Symposia on Health Systems Research, a key global fora for HPSR convened by the largest international society-Health Systems Global (HSG)-provides opportunities to enhance existing research on HPSR capacity using novel analytical techniques. This addresses the demand not only to map the field but also to examine potential predictors of acceptance to, and participation at, these global conferences to inform future work and strategies in promoting HPSR. We examined data from the abstracts submitted for two Global Symposia on Health Systems Research in 2016 and 2018 by type of institution, countries, regional groupings and gender. After mapping hotspot areas for HPSR production, we then examined how the corresponding authors characteristics were associated with being accepted to present at the Global Symposia. Our findings showed that submissions for the Global Symposia increased by 12% from 2016 to 2018. Submissions increased across all participant groups, in particular, the for-profit organizations and research/consultancy firms showing the highest increases, at 58% for both. We also found reduced submissions from high-income countries, whereas submissions from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, increased substantially revealing the inclusivity values of Symposium organizers. Submissions increased to a larger extent among women than men. Being a woman, coming from a high-income country and having multiple abstracts submitted were found to be significant predictors for an abstract to be accepted and presented in the Symposia. Findings provide critical baseline information on the extent of interest and engagement in a global forum of various institutions and researchers in HPSR that can be useful for setting future directions of HSG and other similar organizations to support the advancement of HPSR worldwide.

J	de Sa, SL; Rocha, AAD; Paes, A				de Sa, Sidney Loyola; Rocha, Antonio A. de A.; Paes, Aline			Predicting Popularity of Video Streaming Services with Representation Learning: A Survey and a Real-World Case Study	SENSORS			English	Article						popularity prediction; video; machine learning; word embeddings		The Internet's popularization has increased the amount of content produced and consumed on the web. To take advantage of this new market, major content producers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have emerged, focusing on video streaming services. However, despite the large number and diversity of videos made available by these content providers, few of them attract the attention of most users. For example, in the data explored in this article, only 6% of the most popular videos account for 85% of total views. Finding out in advance which videos will be popular is not trivial, especially given many influencing variables. Nevertheless, a tool with this ability would be of great value to help dimension network infrastructure and properly recommend new content to users. In this way, this manuscript examines the machine learning-based approaches that have been proposed to solve the prediction of web content popularity. To this end, we first survey the literature and elaborate a taxonomy that classifies models according to predictive features and describes state-of-the-art features and techniques used to solve this task. While analyzing previous works, we saw an opportunity to use textual features for video prediction. Thus, additionally, we propose a case study that combines features acquired through attribute engineering and word embedding to predict the popularity of a video. The first approach is based on predictive attributes defined by resource engineering. The second takes advantage of word embeddings from video descriptions and titles. We experimented with the proposed techniques in a set of videos from GloboPlay, the largest provider of video streaming services in Latin America. A combination of engineering features and embeddings using the Random Forest algorithm achieved the best result, with an accuracy of 87%.

An approach based on linguistics features and word embeddings	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Misogyny detection; Text classification; Natural language processing; Machine-learning	CLASSIFICATION; SENTIMENT; SEXISM	Online social networks allow powerless people to gain enormous amounts of control over particular people's lives and profit from the anonymity or social distance that the Internet provides in order to harass other people. One of the most frequently targeted groups comprise women, as misogyny is, unfortunately, a reality in our society. However, although great efforts have recently been made to identify misogyny, it is still difficult to distinguish as it can sometimes be very subtle and deep, signifying that the use of statistical approaches is not sufficient. Moreover, as Spanish is spoken worldwide, context and cultural differences can complicate this identification. Our contribution to the detection of misogyny in Spanish is two-fold. On the one hand, we apply Sentiment Analysis and Social Computing technologies for detecting misogynous messages in Twitter. On the other, we have compiled the Spanish MisoCorpus-2020, a balanced corpus regarding misogyny in Spanish, and classified it into three subsets concerning (1) violence towards relevant women, (2) messages harassing women in Spanish from Spain and Spanish from Latin America, and (3) general traits related to misogyny. Our proposal combines a classification based on average word embeddings and linguistic features in order to understand which linguistic phenomena principally contribute to the identification of misogyny. We have evaluated our proposal with three machine-learning classifiers, achieving the best accuracy of 85.175%. Finally the proposed approach is also validated with existing corpora for misogyny and aggressiveness detection such as AMI and HatEval obtaining good results (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Online Monitoring of Buses Information Using KNN, ATR and DMC Algorithms	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						K-nearest neighbors; artificial intelligence; online monitoring; bus routes	SERVICE	In developing countries such as Brazil, it is still hard to know what time a bus will reach a bus stop. This means that a lot of people have to wait for long periods of time without knowing whether the bus is near or far away, and it raises serious problems of traffic mobility that affect millions of public transport users every day. One way out is to seek solutions based on software and artificial intelligence that can help the public when making their everyday journey. However, most of them still need to be approved by private companies or the local government. This article sets out an online monitoring strategy for bus routes on a collaborative basis, i.e., among the users, as an alternative system that does not need to be authorized by private companies of the local government. It involves adopting the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and creating two new algorithms called Activation of the Regressive Timer and Deactivating Collaborative Mode. The algorithms were implemented in an application called "Olha o Onibus", in English Tracking the Buses, and five tests were conducted to test the effectiveness of the scheme. The results showed that the algorithms are able to ensure the reliability of the information that is shared among the users.

J	Crespo, C				Crespo, Cristian			Two Become One: Improving the Targeting of Conditional Cash Transfers with a Predictive Model of School Dropout	ECONOMIA-JOURNAL OF THE LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Multidimensional targeting; conditional cash transfers; school dropout prediction; machine learning	LATIN-AMERICA; BIG DATA; POOR; EDUCATION; INCOME	This paper offers a methodology to improve targeting design and assessment when two or more groups need to be considered, and trade-offs exist between using different targeting mechanisms. The paper builds from the multidimensional targeting challenge facing conditional cash transfers (CCTs). I analyze whether a common CCT targeting mechanism, namely, a proxy means test (PMT), can identify the poor and future school dropouts effectively. Despite both being key target groups for CCTs, students at risk of dropping out are rarely considered for CCT allocation or in targeting assessments. Using rich administrative data sets from Chile to simulate different targeting mechanisms, I compare the targeting effectiveness of a PMT and other mechanisms based on a predictive model of school dropout. I build this model using machine learning algorithms. Using two novel metrics, I show that combining the outputs of the predictive model with the PMT increases targeting effectiveness except when the social valuation of the poor and future school dropouts differs to a large extent. More generally, public officials who value their key target groups equally may improve policy targeting by modifying their allocation procedures.

We found that: (1) Attention to SET originated in the US in the 1970s, spreading to German-speaking countries in the mid-1990s and continuing in China and Latin America in the early 2000s. (2) SET is commonly viewed as a control tool deserving methodological improvement, while bias is debated in the US. We also found local trajectories: (3) Whereas in the US and Latin America SET is primarily seen as a management tool, German-speaking and Chinese authors reflect more on improving teaching. Chinese scholars consider SET a valid instrument for state control associated with artificial intelligence.

These changes offer unique challenges and opportunities to transform agriculture to smart, more productive, economically remunerative, socially equitable and environmentally sustainable through adoption of smart mechanization technologies. In this paper, the approaches and strategies are highlighted for sustainable mechanization of Indian agriculture. The smart farm mechanization includes application of sensors, controllers, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The research work in the areas of precision agriculture, digital farming, precision irrigation, AI powered machinery, user friendly mobile applications, etc. has gained momentum in India during the last decade. The emerging smart agriculture mechanization combines precision farm with management tools (GPS/GNSS, DSS, VRT), end user ap- plications (platforms, mobile, machines, Agri-bots), data solutions (data IoT, information, tech empowered tools), etc. These technologies not only make farm machinery smart and efficient but also help in saving inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, water and energy for sustainable agriculture.

The platform is divided into two main parts; the first part is the LEGO (R) robots, which have preloaded programs for different math topics (exercises), and the second part runs LabVIEW programs for evaluating the progress of each child. The platform is used as a regular play in the classrooms. The robots are personal tutors for each child during the class. After the students finished to review the math topic with the robot, they have to solve a math exam that includes questions about the reviewed topic with LEGO (R) robot. The main program, which runs the complete math topic in the robot and the exam, was developed in LabVIEW and has an artificial intelligence method for searching the best set of questions and sending feedback regarding the exam results to the child. This platform was validated in two elementary schools located in Xalapa Veracruz, Mexico. The results confirm that the platform helps to increase the kid's motivation about math and it opens new possibilities for teaching mathematics. Moreover, the kids learn at the same time different topics and skills such as robotics, computer science, mechanical systems, teamwork, and leadership.

Control algorithms for legged robots use the equilibrium criteria to avoid falls. The computational efficiency of the equilibrium tests is critical. To comply with this it is necessary to calculate the horizontal momentum rotation for every moment. For arbitrary contact geometries, more complex and computationally-expensive techniques are required. On the other hand designing equilibrium controllers for legged robots is a challenging problem. Nonlinear or more complex control systems have to be designed, complicating the computational cost and demanding robust actuators. In this paper, we propose a force-balanced mechanism as a building element for the synthesis of legged robots that can be easily balance controlled. The mechanism has two degrees of freedom, in opposition to the more traditional one degree of freedom linkages generally used as legs in robotics. This facilitates the efficient use of the "projection of the center of mass" criterion with the aid of a counter rotating inertia, reducing the number of calculations required by the control algorithm. Different experiments to balance the mechanism and to track unstable set-point positions have been done. Proportional error controllers with different strategies as well as learning approaches, based on an artificial intelligence method namely artificial hydrocarbon networks, have been used. Dynamic simulations results are reported. Videos of experiments will be available at: https://sites.google.com/up.edu.mx/smart-robotic-legs/.

Multimodal neurocognitive markers of frontal lobe epilepsy: Insights from ecological text processing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Frontal lobe epilepsy; Cognitive markers; Naturalistic discourse; Multimodal neuroimaging; machine learning	TEMPORAL-LOBE; PARKINSONS; CHILDREN; CONNECTIVITY; NETWORKS; LANGUAGE; MEMORY; WORDS; BRAIN; MOTOR	The pressing call to detect sensitive cognitive markers of frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) remains poorly addressed. Standard frameworks prove nosologically unspecific (as they reveal deficits that also emerge across other epilepsy subtypes), possess low ecological validity, and are rarely supported by multimodal neuroimaging assessments. To bridge these gaps, we examined naturalistic action and non-action text comprehension, combined with structural and functional connectivity measures, in 19 FLE patients, 19 healthy controls, and 20 posterior cortex epilepsy (PCE) patients. Our analyses integrated inferential statistics and data-driven machine-learning classifiers. FLE patients were selectively and specifically impaired in action comprehension, irrespective of their neuropsychological profile. These deficits selectively and specifically correlated with (a) reduced integrity of the anterior thalamic radiation, a subcortical structure underlying motoric and action-language processing as well as epileptic seizure spread in this subtype; and (b) hypoconnectivity between the primary motor cortex and the leftparietal/supramarginal regions, two putative substrates of action-language comprehension. Moreover, machine learning classifiers based on the above neurocognitive measures yielded 75% accuracy rates in discriminating individual FLE patients from both controls and PCE patients. Briefly, action-text assessments, combined with structural and functional connectivity measures, seem to capture ecological cognitive deficits that are specific to FLE, opening new avenues for discriminatory characterizations among epilepsy types.

However, the holistic and complicated nature of the goals has made their attainment difficult. Achieving all goals by 2030 given countries' limited budgets with the economic and social disruption that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused is over-optimistic. To have the most profound impact on the SDGs achievement, prioritising and improving co-beneficial goals is an effective solution. This study confirms that countries' geographic location and income level have a significant relationship with overall SDGs achievement. This article applies the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm to identify the top five SDGs that drive the overall SDG score. The results show that the influential SDGs vary for countries with a specific income level located in different regions. In Europe and Central Asia, SDG10 is among the most influential goals for high-income countries, SDG9 for upper-middle-income, SDG3 in low and lower-middle-income countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, and SDG5 in Latin America and the Caribbean upper-middle-income countries. This systematic and exploratory data-driven study generates new insights that confirm the uniqueness, and non-linearity of the relationship between goals and overall SDGs achievement.

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are common in individuals with HIV-1 Infection, and represent a recent public health problem. Here we evaluate the performance of a recently proposed short protocol for detecting HAND by studying 60 individuals with HIV-1-Infection and 60 seronegative controls from a Caribbean community in Barranquilla, Colombia. The short evaluation protocol used significant neuropsychological tests from a previous study of asymptomatic HIV-1 infected patients and a group of seronegative controls. Brief screening instruments, i.e., the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), were also applied. Using machine-learning techniques, we derived predictive models of HAND status, and evaluated their performance with the ROC curves. The proposed short protocol performs exceptionally well yielding sensitivity, specificity, and overall prediction values >90%, and better predictive capacity than that of the MMSE and IHDS. Community-specific cut-off values for HAND diagnosis, based on the MMSE and IHDS, make this protocol suitable for HAND screening in individuals from this Caribbean community. This study shows the effectivity of a recently proposed short protocol to detect HAND in individuals with asymptomatic HIV-1-Infection.

Learning from Demonstration with Gaussian Process Approach for a Omni-directional Mobile Robot	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						gaussian process; machine learning; regression; supervised learning; robotics		There is great potential in robotics for the application of methodologies related to machine learning, and aiming to the learning from demonstration framework, which helps in a remarkable way to reduce the programming times of the movements of a Robot and in addition to this allows the movements to be more natural and smooth. Machine learning can be found in diverse derivations as the supervised, nonsupervised and reinforced learning. One of the most used is supervised learning, which can be divided into two main tasks: classification and regression. To perform regression, one of the methodologies widely used is the Gaussian Process (GP). Learning from Demonstration (LID) can be seen as a regression problem given a data set. In this article, the development of a learning method based on Gaussian Process and applied to a mobile robotic platform is presented. This implies that the learning has to be performed very fast and incrementally, this because the data arrives frequently and abundantly. The GP offers great precision in learning and meets the characteristics to perform control in robots. This paper investigates the regression methodology using GP as well as its application in demonstration learning.	[Sillas, D.

J	Gallardo, M				Gallardo, Mauricio			<p>Measuring vulnerability to multidimensional poverty with Bayesian network classifiers</p>	ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY			English	Article						Poverty; Vulnerability; Bayesian networks; Bayesian classifiers; Latin America; Chile; Downside risk; Social risk	STOCHASTIC-DOMINANCE; MEAN-SEMIDEVIATION	Bayesian network methods have recently gained great popularity in machine learning literature and applications to model uncertainty in complex phenomena that include relationships between multiple random variables. However, these models are not commonly applied in economics and development studies. Here, we introduce the Bayesian network classifier models to estimate the probability of a person to be welfare deprived in one and multiple dimensions. These probabilities are then used for measuring vulnerability to multidimensional poverty (VMP) in four alternative measurement frameworks. Currently, two of them can be found in the literature, but have been estimated with Probit and Logit models, which are unidimensional strategies. Instead of that, in this study, we follow a multidimensional strategy to solve an estimation problem that is multidimensional in nature. Two new VMP measurement procedures based on Bayesian network classifiers estimates are also introduced in this article. We illustrate the four estimation procedures using the household survey and the census data from Chile 2017. A 5-fold cross-validation exercise verifies a high predictive performance of these Bayesian network classifier models, with the highest accuracy being that of one of the new measurements that we put forward. Our findings reveal that the Bayesian network classifier models offer an adequate alternative to face the policy challenge of measuring vulnerability to multidimensional poverty.

A study of absolute permeability dependence on pore-scale characteristics of carbonate reservoirs using artificial intelligence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OIL GAS AND COAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						neural networks; permeability; pore-scale characteristics; carbonates		An artificial neural network (ANN) was designed and tested in the present study to examine the correlation between permeability estimations and porous medium properties, such as porosity, specific surface area, and irreducible water saturation. The network developed in this work uses soft computing techniques to investigate the absolute permeability dependence on pore-scale characteristics of carbonate reservoirs. The present study indicates that ANN generated permeability values are consistent with those obtained from core analysis. Results from this study confirm the complex relationship among permeability, porosity, specific surface area and irreducible water saturation of carbonate reservoirs, and suggest that variations in specific surface area affect the magnitude of irreducible water saturations, thus creating an apparent dependence of permeability on irreducible water saturation. Additional observations support a direct relationship between porosity and permeability, and an inverse relationship between specific surface area and permeability.

It's high in vitamin C, Calcium, Pectins and is a good source of fiber. Due to concerns with natural and environmental resources, technical issues, and other impediments, the production level decreases day-to-day. However, we'll concentrate on the most critical challenges, such as infections that affect guava plants, fruits, and disease outbreak prevention through early identification. Besides, the early recognition of guava disease using the expert system will lead to higher yields that will eventually help guava farmers reduce their economic losses. In the recent era, image processing and computer vision have been broadly applied to recognize multiple diseases that are not identified with the naked eyes. This article presents a dataset of guava images containing both leaves and fruit images (diseases affected and disease-free) are classified into six classes: for guava fruits-Phytophthora, Scab, Styler end Rot, and Disease-free fruit, and for guava leaves-Red Rust, and diseases-free leave. All images are basically captured from the guava garden located at Bangladesh Agricultural University in July when the guava fruits are almost ripened, and the infections are found in guava plants. This dataset is mainly for those researchers who work with computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning to develop a system that recognizes the guava disease to assist guava farmers in their cultivation.

In soybean production, the country is the second largest producer with 114.0 million tons in the 2016/2017 harvest. Mato Grosso state is the largest Brazilian producer with 30.5 million tons and the port of Santos is mainly requested by being the largest port in Latin America. However, the poor infrastructure of the transport road causes bottlenecks when dispatching soybean through the major ports. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used worldwide in logistics; therefore, we propose to design, train and simulate an ANN on MatLab (c) software to forecast the demand of soybean produced in Mato Grosso and exported through the port of Santos. The value of 9.0 million tons was predicted for 2017 as an increase of about 26.5% compared with the 2016 movement of 7.1 million tons. In addition, it was noticed that 5.9 million tons were moved only in the first five months (Jan-May) of transactions in 2017.

The main feature of such masqueraders is that they have knowledge about the behavior profile of legitimate users. The dataset provided by Schonlau et al. [1], called SEA, has been modified for including synthetic sessions created by masqueraders using the behavior profile of the users intended to impersonate. It is proposed an hybrid method for detection of masqueraders based on the compression of the users sessions and Hidden Markov Models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using ROC curves and compared against other known methods. As shown by our experimental results, the proposed detection mechanism is the best of the methods here considered.

Audio and video files were encoded with distinct cryptographic algorithms and then metadata were extracted from these cryptograms. The algorithm identification is obtained by using data mining techniques. Therefore, the procedure first stage performs the encryption of audio and video files using DES, Blowfish, RSA, and RC4 algorithms. Then, the encrypted files were submitted to the data mining algorithms: J48, FT, PART, Complement Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers. The resulting confusion matrices compiled into charts and it was possible to notice that the percentage of identification for each of the algorithms is greater than a probabilistic bid. There are several scenarios where algorithm identification reaches almost full recognition.	[Almeida, H. L. S.] IBM Brazil, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Almeida, H. L.

Data was collected from multiple sources, including small-scale farmers. Machine learning algorithms combined with expert opinion defined how variation in weather, soils and management practices interact and affect maize yield of small-scale farmers. This knowledge was then used to provide guidelines on management practices likely to produce high, stable yields. The effectiveness of the practices was confirmed in on-farm trials. The principles established can be applied to rainfed crops produced by small-scale farmers to better manage their crops with less risk of failure.

We used three different hyperplanes generation schemes, random, convex hull and a-shape, and evaluated the results on two synthetic and three well known image-based datasets. The results showed considerable improvement in the classification performance in almost all scenarios, corroborating the claim that such an approach can be used as a general-purpose kernel transformation. Also, we discuss some connection with Convolutional Neural Networks and how such an approach could be used to understand such networks better.

Because of that rainfall prediction in Manaus has an additional importance: it improves its citizens well-being. However, predicting rainfall in Manaus is a complex problem because it is under the influence of many precipitating systems. In this work, we addressed the problem of rainfall prediction in Manaus by using multilayer artificial neural networks. The input data was obtained from an automatic weather station during the years of 1970 to 2015. The performance factor considered was the normalized mean squared error. According to the results observed, a feedforward neural network with 2 hidden layers with 10 neurons each was the one that best addressed this problem. We also could see that recurrence in the neural networks did not improve the performance in the problem under consideration.

J	Nita, SL; Mihailescu, MI; Pau, VC				Nita, Stefania Loredana; Mihailescu, Marius Iulian; Pau, Valentin Corneliu			Security and Cryptographic Challenges for Authentication Based on Biometrics Data	CRYPTOGRAPHY			English	Article						machine learning; chaos-based cryptography; Hadoop; data clustering; biometrics		Authentication systems based on biometrics characteristics and data represents one of the most important trend in the evolution of the society, e.g., Smart City, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big Data. In the near future, biometrics systems will be everywhere in the society, such as government, education, smart cities, banks etc. Due to its uniqueness, characteristic, biometrics systems will become more and more vulnerable, privacy being one of the most important challenges. The classic cryptographic primitives are not sufficient to assure a strong level of secureness for privacy. The current paper has several objectives. The main objective consists in creating a framework based on cryptographic modules which can be applied in systems with biometric authentication methods. The technologies used in creating the framework are: C#, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell. The wide range of technologies for developing the algorithms give the readers the possibility and not only, to choose the proper modules for their own research or business direction. The cryptographic modules contain algorithms based on machine learning and modern cryptographic algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption System), SHA-256, RC4, RC5, RC6, MARS, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), Elliptic Curve, and Diffie Hellman. As methods for implementing with success the cryptographic modules, we will propose a methodology which can be used as a how-to guide. The article will focus only on the first category, machine learning, and data clustering, algorithms with applicability in the cloud computing environment. For tests we have used a virtual machine (Virtual Box) with Apache Hadoop and a Biometric Analysis Tool. The weakness of the algorithms and methods implemented within the framework will be evaluated and presented in order for the reader to acknowledge the latest status of the security analysis and the vulnerabilities founded in the mentioned algorithms. Another important result of the authors consists in creating a scheme for biometric enrollment (in Results). The purpose of the scheme is to give a big overview on how to use it, step by step, in real life, and how to use the algorithms. In the end, as a conclusion, the current work paper gives a comprehensive background on the most important and challenging aspects on how to design and implement an authentication system based on biometrics characteristics.

Three-Dimensional Molecular Cartography of the Caribbean Reef-Building Coral Orbicella faveolata	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						molecular cartography; chemical ecology; microbial ecology and diversity; multi-omics; coral reefs; holobiont	NATURAL-PRODUCTS; DIVERSITY; MARINE; COMMUNITIES; MICROBIOME; SEQUENCES; SOFTWARE; PATTERNS; BACTERIA; SAMPLES	All organisms host a diversity of associated viruses, bacteria, and protists, collectively defined as the holobiont. While scientific advancements have enhanced the understanding of the functional roles played by various components of the holobiont, there is a growing need to integrate multiple types of molecular data into spatially and temporally resolved frameworks. To that end, we mapped 16S and 18S rDNA metabarcoding, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomic data onto three-dimensional reconstructions of coral colonies to examine microbial diversity, microbial gene expression, and biochemistry on two colonies of the ecologically important, reef-building coral, Orbicella faveolata and their competitors (i.e., adjacent organisms interacting with the corals: fleshy algae, turf algae, hydrozoans, and other corals). Overall, no statistically significant spatial patterns were observed among the samples for any of the data types; instead, strong signatures of the macroorganismal hosts (e.g., coral, algae, hydrozoa) were detected, in the microbiome, the transcriptome, and the metabolome. The 16S rDNA analysis demonstrated higher abundance of Firmicutes in the coral microbiome than in its competitors. A single bacterial amplicon sequence variant from the genus Clostridium was found exclusively in all O. faveolata samples. In contrast to microbial taxa, a portion of the functionally annotated bacterial RNA transcripts (6.86%) and metabolites (1.95%) were ubiquitous in all coral and competitor samples. Machine learning analysis of microbial transcripts revealed elevated T7-like cyanophage-encoded photosystem II transcripts in O. faveolata samples, while sequences involved in bacterial cell division were elevated in turf algal and interface samples. Similar analysis of metabolites revealed that bacterial-produced antimicrobial and antifungal compounds were highly enriched in coral samples. This study provides insight into the spatial and biological patterning of the coral microbiome, transcriptome, and metabolome.

They exhibit high failure rates which cause significant maintenance downtime. For this reason, there has been an increase in the efforts for designing techniques that allow early failure detection. Fault diagnostics systems based on machine learning are becoming increasingly prominent in this scenario. These techniques have three fundamental steps: signal acquisition, feature extraction and fault classification. The present work aims to provide a detailed analysis at the second and third steps, in the context of producing efficient statistical attributes for bearing fault recognition using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. More specifically, the classifier's performance is studied considering different statistical features, class formulation and different sizes of the window over which features are computed.

We present the details of underwater data acquisition, processing and curation to create this large dataset of coral reef imagery annotated for habitat mapping. A diver-operated hyperspectral imaging system (HyperDiver) was used to survey 147 transects at 8 coral reef sites around the Caribbean island of Curacao. The underwater proximal sensing approach produced fine-scale images of the seafloor, with more than 2.2 billion points of detailed optical spectra. Of these, more than 10 million data points have been annotated for habitat descriptors or taxonomic identity with a total of 47 class labels up to genus- and species-levels. In addition to HyperDiver survey data, we also include images and annotations from traditional (color photo) quadrat surveys conducted along 23 of the 147 transects, which enables comparative reef description between two types of reef survey methods. This dataset promises benefits for efforts in classification algorithms, hyperspectral image segmentation and automated habitat mapping.

We verified whether clinical staff could distinguish between these two types of falls by comparing 3,078 free-text incident reports about falls using a natural language processing technique and a machine learning technique. Common terms were used in reports for both types of falls, but the similarity score between the two types of reports was low, and the performance of identification based on the classification model constructed by support vector machine and deep learning was low.

Getting Its Feet on the Ground: Elucidating Paralouatta's Semi-Terrestriality Using the Virtual Morpho-Functional Toolbox	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						platyrrhine; semi-terrestriality; machine-learning; geometric morphometrics; finite element analysis; Paralouatta; talus	FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE; ANTILLOTHRIX-BERNENSIS; TELL US; PLATYRRHINE; EVOLUTION; MONKEY; EXTINCTION; MODELS; XENOTHRIX	Currently, there are no living platyrrhine primates inhabiting the main Caribbean islands. Nevertheless, the fossil record of this area has provided outstanding findings of different New World monkeys that were part of a diverse radiation exhibiting remarkably unusual morphologies. Among these, the Cuban genus Paralouatta corresponds to one of the most enigmatic primates ever found in the Greater Antilles. Some researchers have argued that Paralouatta's post-cranium shows evidence of semi-terrestriality, a locomotor adaptation that is unusual, if not unique, in platyrrhine evolutionary history. Whether or not Paralouatta was truly semi-terrestrial remains uncertain, however, due to a lack of more sophisticated functional analyses on its morphology. Using novel virtual morpho-functional techniques on a comparative sample of 3D talar models belonging to diverse primate species representing three substrate preferences, this study aims to further evaluate whether Paralouatta was a semi-terrestrial genus or not. Geometric morphometrics and finite element analysis were used to empirically assess shape and biomechanical performance, respectively, and then several machine-learning (ML) classification algorithms were trained using both morphometric and biomechanical data to elucidate the substrate preference of the fossils. The ML algorithms categorized the Paralouatta specimens as either arboreal or as species commonly active on both ground and in trees. These mixed results are suggestive of some level of semi-terrestriality, thus representing the only known example of this locomotor behavior in platyrrhine evolutionary history.

Design/methodology/approach A documental analysis was performed to select HEIs and Brazilian regional development indicators. Then, the assessment of the sustainable and institutional performance of Brazilian municipalities that have HEIs consisted of three parts: clustering with an unsupervised machine learning model, ranking with a hybrid multi-criteria decision making method and visualization of sustainability performance with the dashboard. Findings The critical analysis of institutional and sustainability indicators contributes to a more active role of HEIs in matters of social responsibility, with a more holistic view of the performance and quality of municipal education. Furthermore, this critical analysis creates a scenario where HEIs can develop public policy proposals in partnership with the government to mitigate the main issues identified. Social implications With this study, HEIs will be able to direct their actions to minimize the deficits found in the municipalities, consolidating their social responsibility. Originality/value This study proposes a new decision-support tool with a dashboard of indicators so that HEIs can foster research projects with a focus on regional SD.

We also observe a significant increase in the number of fraud cases, resulting in billions of dollars losses each year worldwide. Therefore it is important and necessary to developed and apply techniques that can assist in fraud detection and prevention, which motivates our research. This work aims to apply and evaluate computational intelligence techniques (e.g., data mining and machine learning) to identify fraud in electronic transactions, more specifically in credit card operations performed by Web payment gateways. In order to evaluate the techniques, we apply and evaluate them in an actual dataset of the most popular Brazilian electronic payment service. Our results show good performance in fraud detection, presenting gains up to 43 percent of an economic metric, when compared to the actual scenario of the company.

Here provided solutions are to detect and deal with student's particular capacities and needs. To cope with this situation the ACACIA project has defined a framework that develops both CADEP centers and technological infrastructure. The former consists of an organizational unit focus on Empowering, Innovating, Educating, Supporting, Monitoring and leveraging institutions in dealing with such diversity. The latter is based on building the required infrastructure to tackle those issues and covering both face-to-face and eLearning educational settings. This comprises non-intrusive affect detection methods along with ambient intelligent solutions, which provide context-aware affective feedback to each student. Preliminary experimentation results open interesting avenues to be further progressed thus taking advantage of current developments on affect computing technologies.

This work focuses on analyzing the social opinion of the inhabitants of Popayan (Colombia), about the architectural heritage of the historical center. The surveys were designed by an interdisciplinary team of architects, environmentalists, chemists, historians, mathematics, engineering, ... that work on Artificial Intelligence applied to the preventive conservation of heritage buildings, and were revised by a sociologist. The results were analyzed as a tool to determine the factors involved in the degree of weakness that historical buildings suffer and estimate the vulnerability and hazards, facing different threats.

Structural and functional motor-network disruptions predict selective action-concept deficits: Evidence from frontal lobe epilepsy	CORTEX			English	Article						Action semantics; Diffusion tensor imaging; Frontal lobe epilepsy; Functional connectivity; Machine learning	PARKINSONS-DISEASE PATIENTS; RESTING-STATE; TEMPORAL-LOBE; CORTICOSPINAL TRACT; LANGUAGE DEFICITS; BRAIN MECHANISMS; SEMANTIC MEMORY; VERBAL FLUENCY; TELL US; CONNECTIVITY	Built on neurodegenerative lesions models, the disrupted motor grounding hypothesis (DMGH) posits that motor-system alterations selectively impair action comprehension. However, major doubts remain concerning the dissociability, neural signatures, and etiological generalizability of such deficits. Few studies have compared action-concept outcomes between disorders affecting and sparing motor circuitry, and none has examined their multimodal network predictors via data-driven approaches. Here, we first assessed action-and object-concept processing in patients with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), patients with posterior cortex epilepsy (PCE), and healthy controls. Then, we examined structural and functional network signatures via diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state connectivity measures. Finally, we used these measures to predict behavioral performance with an XGBoost machine learning regression algorithm. Relative to controls, FLE (but not PCE) patients exhibited selective action-concept deficits together with structural and functional abnormalities along motor networks. The XGBoost model reached a significantly large effect size only for action-concept outcomes in FLE, mainly predicted by structural (cortico-spinal tract, anterior thalamic radiation, uncinate fasciculus) and functional (M1-parietal/supramarginal connectivity) motor networks. These results extend the DMGH, suggesting that action-concept deficits are dissociable markers of frontal/motor (relative to posterior) disruptions, directly related to the structural and functional integrity of motor networks, and traceable beyond canonical movement disorders.

It is driven by the promise of many valuable applications, but made possible, in large part, by the revolutions in technologies such as Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. We are a few decades into the production application of Big Data in industries such as Telecom, Finance, and Media; and nearly a decade into advanced development in areas such as Healthcare, Autonomous Vehicles, and Smart Grid. Shipping involves some unique challenges in networking, analytics, and implementation, but some of the fundamental tasks will be similar. We focus on the issue of Big Data, and on the essential role of understanding the data that exists, the data that will be needed, and, through careful metadata creation and management, the fitness of that data in terms of properties such as: quality, latency, structure, volume/velocity, provenance, and others.

An Intrusion Detection System for Web-Based Attacks Using IBM Watson	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Classification algorithms; Passwords; Measurement; Machine learning algorithms; Intrusion detection; IEEE transactions; Electronic mail; Web applications; cyber attacks; intrusion attack; machine learning; classification; IBM Watson		The internet and web applications have been growing steadily and together with the increasing number of cyber attacks. These attacks are carried out through requests that are considered normal or abnormal (attack requests). Therefore, an intrusion attack can be considered as a classification problem. Machine learning algorithms are used as a way to train models to classify these requests in order to increase the security of web systems. The data used to carry out the training and tests in this work come from the CSIC 2010 dataset. The J48, Naive Bayes, OneR, Random Forest and IBM Watson LGBM algorithms were tested. The metrics used were t-rate, precision, recall and f measure. The results showed that the algorithm used by the Watson tool (LGBM) was the one that did the best in all metrics when compared to the other algorithms in the literature.	[da Silva, Ricardo C.

Deep Learning of High-Resolution Aerial Imagery for Coastal Marsh Change Detection: A Comparative Study	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						deep learning; machine learning; change detection; coastal; marsh; remote sensing; aerial imagery	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SALT-MARSH; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RANDOM FOREST; CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; FUTURE	Deep learning techniques are increasingly being recognized as effective image classifiers. Aside from their successful performance in past studies, the accuracies have varied in complex environments, in comparison with the popularly of applied machine learning classifiers. This study seeks to explore the feasibility of using a U-Net deep learning architecture to classify bi-temporal, high-resolution, county-scale aerial images to determine the spatial extent and changes of land cover classes that directly or indirectly impact tidal marsh. The image set used in the analysis is a collection of a 1-m resolution collection of National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) tiles from 2009 and 2019, covering Beaufort County, South Carolina. The U-Net CNN classification results were compared with two machine learning classifiers, the random trees (RT) and support vector machine (SVM). The results revealed a significant accuracy advantage in using the U-Net classifier (92.4%), as opposed to the SVM (81.6%) and RT (75.7%) classifiers, for overall accuracy. From the perspective of a GIS analyst or coastal manager, the U-Net classifier is now an easily accessible and powerful tool for mapping large areas. Change detection analysis indicated little areal change on marsh extent, though increased land development throughout the county has the potential to negatively impact the health of the marshes. Future work should explore applying the constructed U-Net classifier to coastal environments in large geographic areas, while also implementing other data sources (e.g., LIDAR and multispectral data) to enhance classification accuracy.

Vegetative indices were used as features to drive the corresponding classification by processing RGB/VIS imagery. In this regard, we used four Machine Learning models to identify the stage of maturity for the fruits: Multi-variable regressions, Naives Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. These models were trained and tested with the features of each variety. Experimental results were validated by calculating ROC data, in which neural networks achieved an accuracy of 99% in the stage of maturity identification for the three amazonian varieties. These results allow us to conclude that the used vegetative indices accurately correlate with the physiological characteristics of the fruits, being relevant for the stage of maturity of the three varieties.

We used a hierarchical experimental design with four random factors representing four different spatial scales: (1) region (hundreds of kilometers), (2) localities (tens of kilometers), (2) reef sites (hundreds of meters) and (3) transects (a couple meters) across the Venezuelan coast. At each site, four 30-m transects were deployed parallel to the coastline, and 15 pictures were taken every other meter at each transect, containing an area of at least 80 x 90cm with enough resolution to identify benthic groups. This dataset covers spatial scales from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers; marine protected areas, and non-protected areas; coastal zones, continental and oceanic islands. These images have the potential to be further used for training researchers in benthic organisms identification, and training artificial intelligence classification algorithms. Also, they represent and updated baseline to perform spatial and temporal comparisons in Venezuela or further studies involving multiple spatial scales in the region.

This comparison is in terms of accuracy of the prediction, and the time required to execute the algorithms. For this purpose, a lap-joint specimen with two different sizes of artificial debonding is created. The data acquired from applying ultrasonic guided waves through angle beam transducers and by a B-scan along the overlap region several times. Using signal processing techniques, different features are extracted from received signals and binary classifications are carried out on these features. Logistic loss, smoothed hinge loss and regularized least square loss are three different functions used for classifications. To find the optimal parameters of the two former loss functions, three optimization algorithms are used including stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) and fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA).

Seizing Requirements Engineering Issues through Supervised Learning Techniques	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Software; Requirements engineering; Support vector machines; Supervised learning; Forestry; Predictive models; IEEE transactions; Machine Learning; Requirement Engineering; Software Requirement; Supervised Learning	PREDICTION; QUALITY	In recent years, the popularity of machine learning techniques has grown due to the availability of larges volumes of data and the increased processing capacity of computers. Despite the inherent value of these techniques, few studies have attempted to summarize how machine learning algorithms, especially supervised learning have contributed to task automation and resolving challenges in Requirements Engineering. This paper proposes a systematic mapping of the literature to identify and analyze proposals which employ supervised learning in Requirements Engineering between 2002-2018. The goal of this research is to identify trends, datasets, and methods used. Thirty-three studies were selected based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results show that researches using these techniques focuses on eight broad categories: detection of linguistic problems in requirements documents and artifacts written in natural language, classification of document content, traceability, effort estimation, requirements analysis, failures prediction, quality and detection of business rules. The most used supervised learning algorithms were Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Random Forest. Twenty-five public and twenty -eight private data sources were identified. Among the most used public data sources are Predictor Models in Software Engineering, iTrust Electronic Health Care System and Metric Data Program from NASA.

Automatic Cyberbullying Detection: a Mexican case in High School and Higher Education students	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Cyberbullying; Radio frequency; Blogs; Videos; IEEE transactions; Deep learning; Computational modeling; Bullying; Cyberbullying; Machine learning; Social networks; Deep learning		The social interaction among young students has been partially or totally transformed to mobile-based communication, specifically through the use of social networks. This new communication environment has allowed a more immediate, diverse and massive interaction, offering a faster and more effective situation when carrying out academic and recreational activities. However, this scenario has also promoted the phenomenon of social harassment known as bullying, exponentially increasing its scope and diversifying the types and forms of aggression. Machine learning and natural language processing techniques have been used to create models that detect bullying situations among students, using data corpus from mainly public social networks. However, generally, these data sources are not representative of the social networks commonly used by the students; generating classification models that do not consider the vocabulary used by this social group. This article describes the methodology used to create a representative data corpus of the interaction between Mexican high school and university students, and a comparative analysis on characteristics that influence the quality of the content of a corpus in this domain. In addition, the performance achieved by implementing various machine learning models to identify bullying situations is presented. The best result is reported for the Naive Bayesian classifier (F1-Score of 0.862), performing better than models based on deep learning such as Recurrent (F1-Score of 0.845) and Convolutional (F1-Score of 0.807) Neural Networks.

On the Use of Satellite Nightlights for Power Outages Prediction	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Predictive models; Hurricanes; Wind speed; Power system reliability; Storms; Spatial resolution; Data models; Power outage prediction; machine learning; weather simulation; extreme events; night-time light	ECONOMIC-ACTIVITY; POPULATION; VALIDATION; IMPACTS; LIGHTS; IMAGES; DAMAGE	Hurricanes are a dominant disaster in the Caribbean, always causing serious power outages throughout the islands. Hurricane Maria was a prime example, causing unimaginable destruction of the power infrastructure of Puerto Rico (PR). Consequently, one month after the hurricane landfall, approximately 80% of the population was still without power. After an event of such massive destruction, the electric power restoration process progresses very slowly. This timeline can be improved using power outage (PO) forecast models that help identify the vulnerable places before the hurricane landfall. Generally, these models are trained with historical power outages records, associated data on weather conditions, and additional information about the natural and built environments. However, PO records are often difficult to acquire, and, in many instances, the power utility companies may not record them. This study utilizes a satellite-based Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) night light data product as a surrogate for the power delivery to predict hurricane-induced PO in areas having limited to nonexistent historical data records. The processed satellite data is then used along with geographic variables, and simulated weather data to formulate machine learning-based algorithms to predict PO for future hurricane events. These models are applied and validated in the context of the PR catastrophic storm, Hurricane Maria.

Most research to date has focused on using US images of muscle to predict human movement intentions. However, the richness of unprocessed US signals as a source of neuromuscular information may have been left unnoticed. In the present study, we investigate the feasibility of using unprocessed US signals of muscle tissue to continuously predict knee motion kinematics during seated knee flexion/extension and sit-to-stand movements. Unprocessed US signals were compared to US images using a mutual information analysis to quantify the information gained from each of these US data forms about knee motion. The motion prediction accuracy of unprocessed US signals was compared to motion prediction accuracy of US images. It was observed that a statistically comparable amount of information can be gained from both US data forms (p < 0.05). The prediction accuracies were also statistically comparable (p < 0.05), and average root mean squared error for knee angle prediction was 1.66 degrees when using unprocessed US signals compared to 2.25 degrees when using US images. Noteworthy, the computation speed was around 33 frames per second (FPS) when using US images compared to 251 FPS when using unprocessed US signals. Overall, this study highlights the promise of unprocessed US signals as a source of neuromuscular information for human motion prediction in real-time, while omitting the signal processing steps required to reconstruct the US images and the associated engineering sophistication, facilitating the future integration of US sensing as a human-machine interface.

The ICON program has pioneered the use of artificial intelligence techniques to assess near real-time data streams from environment sensor networks such as the SEAKEYS Network (Florida Keys), the Australia Institute of Marine Science Weather Network, NOAA's Coral Reef Ecosystem Division network in the Pacific, and its own Integrated Coral Observing Network (ICON) of stations in the Caribbean. Besides its innovative approach to coral monitoring station deployments, the ICON program recently pioneered techniques for the near real-time integration of satellite, in situ and radar data sources for purposes of ecological forecasting of such events as coral bleaching, coral spawning, upwelling and other marine behavioral or physical oceanographic events. The ICON program has also ushered in the use of Pulse-Amplitude-Modulating fluorometry to measure near real-time physiological recording of response to environmental stress during coral bleaching, thus providing even better ecological forecasting capabilities through artificial intelligence and data integrative techniques. Herewith, we describe these techniques, along with a report on new coral calcification instrumentation augmenting the ICON Network sensor array.

It has been operational since November 2012 and delivers approximately 50 predictions each day for countries of Latin America. EMBERS is built on a streaming, scalable, loosely coupled, shared-nothing architecture using ZeroMQ as its messaging backbone and JSON as its wire data format. It is deployed on Amazon Web Services using an entirely automated deployment process. We describe the architecture of the system, some of the design tradeoffs encountered during development, and specifics of the machine learning models underlying EMBERS. We also present a detailed prospective evaluation of EMBERS in forecasting significant societal events in the past 2 years.

Identifying Roadway Surface Disruptions Based on Accelerometer Patterns	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						road surface disruptions; RSD; mobile computing; mobile sensing; machine learning algorithms		In developed countries large-scale technology is used for the monitoring and management of road infrastructure. Sensor networks together with surveillance cameras help identify elements disturbing cars' mobility. On the contrary, in developing countries, the lack of this level of infrastructure makes the task of roads' maintenance and traffic control challenging. The presence of roadway surface disruptions (RSDs), in particular, affects the economy and reputation of individuals and companies. Urban computing strategies can be adopted to collect data about the presence of RSDs and be applied to monitor traffic related issues. The implementation of such level of navigation assistance could help save freight and money to companies and authorities, and even reduce cars' accidents. In this direction, current mobile technologies can help with the identification and location of road imperfections alerting drivers about alternative routes. In this paper we present our work that seeks to enable citizens' cars as road watchers. By means of the mobile phones' acceleration sensing capabilities we are identifying and tagging the presence of RSDs. Using Android-based devices situated on the copilot floor side of a car, 5 Mbytes of road information has been collected. We run a series of experiments aiming to differentiate acceleration patterns associated to potholes, speed bumps, metal humps and rough roads. Currently, the classification of disruptions is being experimented with techniques from the field of Machine Learning (ML) such as artificial neuronal networks and logistic regression. Classification of individual events is over 86% of accuracy that is competitive with those reported in the literature. In this work we provide the first public dataset that could be used by other researchers to offer more insight in this problem.	[Gonzalez, L. C.; Martinez, F.; Carlos, M.

It also allows a better understanding of global climate regulation as a potential carbon sink or source. Large area assessments usually require data from spaceborne remote sensors, but most of them cannot measure the vertical variability of vegetation structure, which is required for accurately measuring fuel loads and defining management interventions. The recently launched NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) full-waveform lidar sensor holds potential to meet this demand. However, its capability for estimating fuel load has yet not been evaluated. In this study, we developed a novel framework and tested machine learning models for predicting multi-layer fuel load in the Brazilian tropical savanna (i.e., Cerrado biome) using GEDI data. First, lidar data were collected using an unnamed aerial vehicle (UAV). The flights were conducted over selected sample plots in distinct Cerrado vegetation formations (i.e., grassland, savanna, forest) where field measurements were conducted to determine the load of surface, herbaceous, shrubs and small trees, woody fuels and the total fuel load. Subsequently, GEDI-like full-waveforms were simulated from the high-density UAV-lidar 3-D point clouds from which vegetation structure metrics were calculated and correlated to field-derived fuel load components using Random Forest models. From these models, we generate fuel load maps for the entire Cerrado using all on-orbit available GEDI data. Overall, the models had better performance for woody fuels and total fuel loads (R-2 = 0.88 and 0.71, respectively). For components at the lower stratum, models had moderate to low performance (R-2 between 0.15 and 0.46) but still showed reliable results. The presented framework can be extended to other fire-prone regions where accurate measurements of fuel components are needed. We hope this study will contribute to the expansion of spaceborne lidar applications for integrated fire management activities and supporting carbon monitoring initiatives in tropical savannas worldwide.

Various parts of Asia and Latin America are affected but highest malaria incidence is found in Sub-Saharan Africa. Standard diagnosis of malaria comprises microscopic detection of parasites in stained thick and thin blood films. As the process of slide reading under the microscope is an error-prone and tedious issue we are developing computer-assisted microscopy systems to support detection and diagnosis of malaria. In this paper we focus on a deep learning (DL) approach for the detection of plasmodia and the evaluation of the proposed approach in comparison with two reference approaches. The proposed classification schemes have been evaluated with more than 180,000 automatically detected and manually classified plasmodia candidate objects from socalled thick smears. Automated solutions for the morphological analysis of malaria blood films could apply such a classifier to detect plasmodia in the highly complex image data of thick smears and thereby shortening the examination time. With such a system diagnosis of malaria infections should become a less tedious, more reliable and reproducible and thus a more objective process. Better quality assurance, improved documentation and global data availability are additional benefits.

The usability of wearable technology is versatile in its application, where it can be used to monitor and track the human movement including clinical applications. Classification studies of trajectory data are required for a diversity of hand and limb movements tracking experiments. Automatic classification using machine learning techniques has the potential to increase the reliability and efficiency of predicting the outcome of results without the need of human manual intervention. This work presents a wearable sensing electronic device for tracking and classify real-time hand strike motion in a combat sport activity. The developed low-cost system consists of a small footprint printed-circuit board of dimensions 11 mm x 24 mm x 4 mm with integrated motion sensors operating at 3.3 V, contributing to a battery running time of 3 hours. This meets the requirements for the targeted application. The K-Nearest Neighbor machine learning algorithm was adopted for the classification of hand combat techniques, yielding a classification and an optimal strike prediction accuracy of 99%, using only 20% of the available dataset.											8	0	0	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-7281-7670-3				2021										10.1109/LASCAS51355.2021.9459180			4	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BS1RD					2022-06-04	WOS:000694865300057

Including Conversational Agents into Structured Hybrid 3D Virtual Environments	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE Latin-America Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)	NOV 24-26, 2013	Santiago, CHILE	IEEE Commun Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers		3D Virtual Worlds; Human-Computer Interaction; AIML		Structured Hybrid 3D Virtual Environments are 3D virtual spaces where staff (organisational) software agents support human users in their task achievement. These systems are characterized by: i) being hybrid, so that humans and software agents can interact; and ii) being structured and task oriented, so that interactions are regulated by a subjacent Organisation Centered Multi Agent System (OCMAS) - an Electronic Institution (EI). The contribution of this paper is to include task-oriented conversational staff bots (i. e. the embodiment of staff agents in the 3D environment) that communicate with users by using natural language. With this aim, we extend the Artificial Intelligence Mark-up Language (AIML) with special tags to enable complex task-oriented conversations whose flow needs to consider both the states of the conversation and the ontology related to the task. We evaluate the usability of our conversational proposal and compare it to a previous command-based interaction system. Results show the conversational approach presents a higher user satisfaction than the command-based one. Moreover, in average, it also performs better in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and errors.	[Almajano, P.] Univ Barcelona, CSIC, IIIA, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Sanchez, M.

Modelling cellphone trace travel mode with neural networks using transit smartcard and home interview survey data	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH			English	Article						cellphone traces; cellular network data; transit smartcard; machine learning; mode detection	DEMAND ESTIMATION; BIG DATA; PHONE; PATTERNS; LOCATIONS; FLOW	This study proposes a framework to impute travel mode for trips identified from cellphone traces by developing a deep neural network model. In our framework, we use the trips from a home interview survey and transit smartcard data, for which the travel mode is known, to create a set of artificial pseudo-cellphone traces. The generated artificial pseudo-cellphone traces with known mode are then used to train a deep neural network classifier. We further apply the trained model to infer travel modes for the cellphone traces from cellular network data. The empirical case study region is Montevideo, Uruguay, where high-quality data are available for all three types of data used in the analysis: a large dataset of cellphone traces, a large dataset of public transit smartcard transactions, and a small household travel survey. The results can be used to create an enhanced representation of origin-destination trip-making in the region by time of day and travel mode.

Arboviruses mainly affect tropical countries. Brazil has the largest absolute number of cases in Latin America. This work presents a unified data set with clinical, sociodemographic, and laboratorial data on confirmed patients of Dengue and Chikungunya, as well as patients ruled out of infection from these diseases. The data is based on case notification data submitted to the Brazilian Information System for Notifiable Diseases, from Portuguese Sistema de Informacao de Agravo de Notificacao (SINAN), from 2013 to 2020. The original data set comprised 13,421,230 records and 118 attributes. Following a pre-processing process, a final data set of 7,632,542 records and 56 attributes was generated. The data presented in this work will assist researchers in investigating antecedents of arbovirus emergence and transmission more generally, and Dengue and Chikungunya in particular. Furthermore, it can be used to train and test machine learning models for differential diagnosis and multi-class classification.

Computational evaluation of coral reef aesthetics	PEERJ			English	Article						Image analysis; Coral reef; Aesthetics; Machine learning; Reef degradation	PERCEPTUAL FLUENCY; COASTAL ZONE; PREFERENCE; TOURISM	The natural beauty of coral reefs attracts millions of tourists worldwide resulting in substantial revenues for the adjoining economies. Although their visual appearance is a pivotal factor attracting humans to coral reefs current monitoring protocols exclusively target biogeochemical parameters, neglecting changes in their aesthetic appearance. Here we introduce a standardized computational approach to assess coral reef environments based on 109 visual features designed to evaluate the aesthetic appearance of art. The main feature groups include color intensity and diversity of the image, relative size, color, and distribution of discernable objects within the image, and texture. Specific coral reef aesthetic values combining all 109 features were calibrated against an established biogeochemical assessment (NCEAS) using machine learning algorithms. These values were generated for similar to 2,100 random photographic images collected from 9 coral reef locations exposed to varying levels of anthropogenic influence across 2 ocean systems. Aesthetic values proved accurate predictors of the NCEAS scores (root mean square error <5 for N >= 3) and significantly correlated to microbial abundance at each site. This shows that mathematical approaches designed to assess the aesthetic appearance of photographic images can be used as an inexpensive monitoring tool for coral reef ecosystems. It further suggests that human perception of aesthetics is not purely subjective but influenced by inherent reactions towards measurable visual cues. By quantifying aesthetic features of coral reef systems this method provides a cost efficient monitoring tool that targets one of the most important socioeconomic values of coral reefs directly tied to revenue for its local population.

While electronic contracts allow automated processes to verify their correctness, most agreements in the real world are still written in natural language, which need substantial human revision effort to eliminate possible conflicting statements in long and complex contracts. In this paper, we formalize a typology of conflict types between clauses suitable for machine learning and develop techniques to review contracts by learning to identify and classify such conflicts, facilitating the task of contract revision. We evaluate the effectiveness of our techniques using a manually annotated contract conflict corpus with results close to the current state-of-the-art for conflict identification, while introducing a more complex classification task of such conflicts for which our method surpasses the state-of-the art method.

The objective is to model the traffic of the wireless network, since it is underused in this region of Latin America. Hence, some tools are studied to allow the structuring of the type of traffic seen in the network. Based on stochastic tools such as the log-scale diagram, the linear multiscale diagram, and the multifractal spectrum, this research aims to verify the multifractality of tragic series collected on the electric radio spectrum of Bogota, Colombia in 2012, In fact, the study reveals that all the channels of the network have a multifractal behavior with 90% of them presenting a Hurst parameter in the 0.5 to 1 range. The evidence suggests that the traffic in this region could be modeled as multifractal time series. Therefore, the analysis carried out intends to provide a new modeling method for the Colombian radioelectric spectrum in the farm of multifractal-based analysis.

More and more approaches have been developed on top of DL models, also due to the unprecedented amount of software-related data that can be used to train these models. One of the recent applications of DL in the software engineering domain concerns the automatic detection of software vulnerabilities. While several DL models have been developed to approach this problem, there is still limited empirical evidence concerning their actual effectiveness especially when compared with shallow machine learning techniques. In this paper, we partially fill this gap by presenting a large-scale empirical study using three vulnerability datasets and five different source code representations (i.e., the format in which the code is provided to the classifiers to assess whether it is vulnerable or not) to compare the effectiveness of two widely used DL-based models and of one shallow machine learning model in (i) classifying code functions as vulnerable or non-vulnerable (i.e., binary classification), and (ii) classifying code functions based on the specific type of vulnerability they contain (or "clean", if no vulnerability is there). As a baseline we include in our study the AutoML utility provided by the Google Cloud Platform. Our results show that the experimented models are still far from ensuring reliable vulnerability detection, and that a shallow learning classifier represents a competitive baseline for the newest DL-based models.

The control architecture is composed of three basic behaviors: obstacle avoidance, left wall following and right wall following. The mechanism of fusion behavior was performed on a weighting system that acquires information from the environment and calculates fuzzy dynamic weighting factors adjusted to the region in which the robot travels. These factors influence the output of each behavior giving strength to the most appropriate action according to the current situation of the environment. Subsequently, the weighted outputs of each behavior are normalized by the command fusion, achieving a cooperative solution to meeting the robot navigation target.	[Zapata, O.; Jimenez, J.

This condition is mostly transmitted by triatomines which are haematophagous insects all their life. With 154 species described in the world, the correct determination of the species involved in the transmission is crucial to develop efficient control strategies. This can be achieved by taxonomic keys (available only for adult stages, nymphal instars must be reared), or by molecular techniques. Both are time and/or money consuming, showing the needs of new identification tools, especially for nymphal instars which are the most frequently found on the field. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VIS-NIR), used successfully these last years in various organisms' determination, was applied on a sample of three species from Bolivia: Triatoma infestans, Triatoma sordida and Triatoma guasayana. The spectrum of the dorsal part of the head from nymphal instars and adult stages was taken for each specimen of each species. Different methods of preprocessing and selection of variables (wavelengths) were tested to find the best model of classification for the three species. Each model was evaluated by different indices: accuracy, specificity, and F1 score. The comparison of the performance of each model evidenced that the best results were obtained when using a short spectrum (400-2000 nm) without pre-processing. A total of 32 components were retained by tuning, and 933 wavelengths were kept by the backward feature selection algorithm. Applying it on a new sample of insects, this model showed a global accuracy of 97.2% (95.0-98.6). The F1 score was greater than 0.95, and the specificity greater than 0.94 for all the species. For the first time, a tool is available to quickly identify and with a high accuracy nymphal instars and adults of triatomines.

The study of civil unrest is a key topic for political scientists as it helps capture an important mechanism by which citizenry express themselves. In countries where civil unrest is lawful, qualitative analysis has revealed that more than 75% of the protests are planned, organized, and/or announced in advance; therefore detecting future time mentions in relevant news and social media is a direct way to develop a protest forecasting system. We develop such a system in this paper, using a combination of key phrase learning to identify what to look for, probabilistic soft logic to reason about location occurrences in extracted results, and time normalization to resolve future tense mentions. We illustrate the application of our system to 10 countries in Latin America, viz. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Results demonstrate our successes in capturing significant societal unrest in these countries with an average lead time of 4.08 days. We also study the selective superiorities of news media versus social media (Twitter, Facebook) to identify relevant tradeoffs.

PV solar power generation has intrinsic characteristics related to the climatic variables that cause intermittence during the generation process, promoting instabilities and insecurity in the electrical system. One of the solutions for this problem uses methods for the Prediction of Solar Photovoltaic Power Generation (PSPPG). In this context, the aim of this study is to develop and compare the prediction accuracy of solar irradiance between Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long-Term Short Memory (LSTM) network models, from a comprehensive analysis that simultaneously considers two distinct sets of exogenous meteorological input variables and three short-term prediction horizons (1, 15 and 60 min), in a controlled experimental environment. The results indicate that there is a significant difference (p < 0.001) in the prediction accuracy between the ANN and LSTM models, with better overall prediction accuracy skill for the LSTM models (MAPE = 19.5%), except for the 60 min prediction horizon. Furthermore, the accuracy difference between the ANN and LSTM models decreased as the prediction horizon increased, and no significant influence was observed on the accuracy of the prediction with both sets of evaluated meteorological input variables.

For new EMGs signals interpretations and application developments, data acquisition systems required advanced and precise signal processing, decomposition and classification methods that allow improvement of the understanding and knowledge of the EMGs signal behaviour. Generally signal analysis are carried out by Fourier, Gabor and Wavelet analysis, beside artificial intelligence techniques. The purpose of this article is to show how traditional techniques have been used in the processing, decomposition and classification of the EMGs signals, along with some results obtained by using wavelet analysis to study their dynamical behaviour (multi-resolution analysis). This results as a contribution can be applied to different types biomedical signals.	[Mendoza, L.

While these city-level factors help to improve the quality of distance approximation functions for city-wide vehicle movements, more granular factors are needed to obtain accurate shortest path distance approximations for last-mile transportation systems that are typically characterized by local trips. More importantly, local circuity factors encode valuable information about the efficiency and complexity of the urban road network, which can be leveraged to inform policy and practice. In this paper, we quantify and analyze local network circuity leveraging contemporary traffic datasets. Using the city of Sao Paulo as our primary case study and a combination of supervised and un-supervised machine learning methods, we observe significant heterogeneities in local network circuity, explained by dimensional and topological properties of the road network. Locally, real trip distances are about twice as long as distances predicted by the L-1 norm. Results from Sao Paulo are compared to seven additional urban areas in Latin America and the United States. At a coarse-grained level of analysis, we observe similar correlations between road network properties and local circuity across these cities.

Without its many advantages, the next generation of communications systems would not be able to meet most of the requirements necessary to be called 5G. However, several challenges had to be solved from its inception until its adoption. Nowadays, with most of them overcome, researchers are turning their attention to novel ways to enhance the technology and have it once more being an essential feature of the next generation of communications systems, e.g., 6G. This work provides a brief but comprehensive overview of the technology known as Massive MIMO, its challenges, available solutions, and novel research directions. Additionally, we provide discussions on the use of Massive MIMO in Terahertz bands and the use of Machine Learning algorithms for channel estimation and signal detection tasks in such systems.

HIRE, for example, is used in the systematic literature review task, where the goal is to identify all relevant scientific articles. The documents selected by HIRE as relevant define the user effort to identify the target information. On this way, one of HIRE goals is only to return relevant documents avoiding overburning the user with non-relevant information. Traditionally, supervised machine learning algorithms are used as HIRE' core to produce a ranking of relevant documents (e.g. SVM). However, such algorithms depend on an initial training set (seed) to start the process of learning. In this work, we propose a new approach to produce the initial seed for HIRE focus on reducing the user effort. Our approach combines an active learning approach with a raking strategy to select only the informative examples. The experimentation shows that our approach is able to reduce until 18% the labeling effort with competitive recall.

Schiller; IFICPC; EFC; Artificial intelligence	INTERNATIONAL-FEDERATION; VISUAL INSPECTION; ACETIC-ACID; INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA; COLPOSCOPY; PATHOLOGY; TERMINOLOGY; CANCER; CARCINOMA; PRECANCER	Objectives: We aim to describe the history of iodine testing of the cervix and identify areas where further work is required. Study design: We conducted a search of PubMed and Google Scholar. Full article texts were reviewed. Reference lists were screened for additional articles and books. 37 basic articles in journals including ones written in German and three basic articles in books were identified. Results: Glycogen staining of the ectocervical squamous epithelium with iodine goes back to Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915). Walter Schiller (1887-1960) examined nearly 200 different dyes and found that vital staining of the cervical squamous epithelium was best achieved with Lugol's iodine solution, which was indicated by Jean Guillaume Lugol (1786-1851) for disinfection of the vagina. In 1928 W. Lahm observed that the glycogen content of a squamous epithelium cell decreases as anaplasia increases. From the outset, H. Hinselmann included the iodine test in the minimum requirements for colposcopy. In 1946 H. J. Wespi first mentioned the finding of an "uncharacteristic iodine negative area." The first international colposcopic terminology from Graz in 1975 lists the "iodine light area" among the different colposcopy findings. The IFCPC nomenclatures from Rome 1990, Barcelona 2002, and Rio de Janeiro 2011 have evaluated the iodine test and classified their findings differently. A breakthrough to effective cervical cancer screening in resource-limited settings in Africa, India, and Latin America was achieved with R. Sankaranarayanan's publication on naked-eye visual inspection of the cervix after application of Lugol's iodine. Conclusions: This paper is a step toward a better understanding of what we think and do today with iodine testing and what problems and upcoming tasks will arise in future.

Monitoring of FSA is typically conducted by divers, but surveys are often restricted to a limited area and dependent upon sea conditions, thus our knowledge of FSA dynamics is extremely limited. Fisheries independent research strives for new technology that can help remotely and unobtrusively quantify fish biomass and abundance. Since some fish species, such as groupers, produce sounds during reproductive behaviors, Eulerian passive acoustic monitoring provides information when divers cannot access the FSA site. Fish sounds provide an innovative approach to assess fish presence and potentially their numbers during reproductive events. However, this technology is limited by the sound propagation range, hence the distance between the fish emitting sounds and the hydrophone location. As such, this Eulerian monitoring approach implicitly creates a knowledge gap about what happens beyond the range of the recorders. Furthermore, the large datasets make the detection process by human ears and eyes very tedious and inconsistent. This paper reports on two innovative approaches to overcome these limitations. To facilitate fish call detections, we have developed an algorithm based on machine learning and voice recognition methods to identify and classify the sounds known to be produced by certain species during FSA. This algorithm currently operates on a SV3 Liquid Robotics wave glider, an autonomous surface vehicle which has been fitted to accommodate a passive acoustic listening device and can cover large areas under a wide range of sea conditions. Fish sounds detections, classification results, and locations along with environmental data are transmitted in real-time enabling verification of the sites with high detections by divers or other in situ methods. Recent surveys in the US Virgin Islands with the SV3 Wave Glider are revealing for the first time the spatial and temporal distribution of fish calls surrounding known FSA sites. These findings are critical to understanding the dynamics of fish populations because calling fish were detected several kilometers away from the known FSAs. These courtship associated sounds from surrounding areas suggest that other FSAs may exist in the region.

An agent usually starts a conversation by querying another agent because it needs to satisfy a specific goal. This process allocates a new goal to the agent receiving the initial query, starting new dialogs with other agents, generating a recursive interaction. The generation of this kind of dialog is interesting when the system has the possibility of generating conditional answers with imprecise and uncertain values. We consider simple deliberative rule-based agents that proactively try to satisfy their goals. The mechanism to achieve this dialogs is based in the specialization of the mental state of agents, by means of the partial deduction of rule bases.

Screening for sight-threatening DR (STDR) is the first cost-effective step to decrease this burden. We analyzed the similarities and variations between the recent country-specific and the International Council of Ophthalmology (ICO) DR guideline to identify gaps and suggest possible solutions for future universal screening. We selected six representative national DR guidelines, one from each World Health Organization region, including Canada (North America), England (Europe), India (South- East Asia), Kenya (Africa), New Zealand (Western Pacific), and American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern (used in Latin America and East Mediterranean). We weighed the newer camera and artificial intelligence (AI) technology against the traditional screening methodologies. All guidelines agree that screening for DR and STDR in people with diabetes is currently led by an ophthalmologist; few engage non-ophthalmologists. Significant variations exist in the screening location and referral timelines. Screening with digital fundus photography has largely replaced traditional slit-lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy. The use of mydriatic digital 2-or 4-field fundus photography is the current norm; there is increasing interest in using non-mydriatic fundus cameras. The use of automated DR grading and tele-screening is currently sparse. Country-specific guidelines are necessary to align with national priorities and human resources. International guidelines such as the ICO DR guidelines remain useful in countries where no guidelines exist. Validation studies on AI and tele-screening call for urgent policy decisions to integrate DR screening into universal health coverage to reduce this global public health burden.

Text processing techniques and machine learning algorithms have been extensively used to solve this problem. In this paper we compare three clustering algorithms - k-means, k-medoids and NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) - in order to detect topics related to textual messages obtained from Twitter. The algorithms were applied to a database composed by tweets, having as initial context hashtags that are related to the recent scandal of corruption involving FIFA (International Federation of Football Association). Obtained results suggest that the NMF presents better results, since it provides providing clusters that are easier to interpret.	[Klinczak, Marjori N.

The ASD diagnosis is usually performed through several sessions of behavioral observation, exhaustive screening, and manual coding behavior. The early detection of ASD signs in naturalistic behavioral observation may be improved through Child-Robot Interaction (CRI) and technological-based tools for automated behavior assessment. Robot-assisted tools using CRI theories have been of interest in intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (CwASD), elucidating faster and more significant gains from the diagnosis and therapeutic intervention when compared to classical methods. Additionally, using computer vision to analyze child's behaviors and automated video coding to summarize the responses would help clinicians to reduce the delay of ASD diagnosis. In this article, a CRI to enhance the traditional tools for ASD diagnosis is proposed. The system relies on computer vision and an unstructured and scalable network of RGBD sensors built upon Robot Operating System (ROS) and machine learning algorithms for automated face analysis. Also, a proof of concept is presented, with participation of three typically developing (TD) children and three children in risk of suffering from ASD.

The relatively affluent in these countries circumvent the problem by installing grid-connected backup systems, which provide uninterrupted supply. However, these backup systems increase losses and burden the local electricity grid. For instance, estimates show that in Pakistan, between 2%- 3% of annual energy generation is lost through battery charging. In addition, due to these elite backup systems, over 10% of all distribution transformers are overloaded. This overload causes needless expenditure that developing countries can not afford, as well as greenhouse gas emissions which accelerate climate change. This paper investigates various data-driven optimal control strategies to improve backup systems' operational efficiency. Preliminary results show that by employing a smart controller, household energy consumption can be reduced by 3%- 7%, while grid overload costs can be reduced by almost a quarter. Furthermore, model-assisted reinforcement learning controller is able to approach the performance of data-driven model predictive control at a fraction of the computational cost while far outperforming model-free reinforcement learning algorithm.

The changes as a proportion of national population were compared, adjusting by the beginning of test-positive cases increase (BPI) or deaths increase (BDI). Remarkable regional differences of more than 100-fold in NPDP and NPDD were observed. The trajectories of NPDD after BDI increased exponentially within 20 days in most countries. Machine learning analysis suggested that NPDD on 30 days after BDI was the highest in developed Western countries (1180 persons per hundred million), followed by countries in the Middle East (128), Latin America (97), and Asia (7). Furthermore, in Western countries with positive rates of the PCR test of less than 7.0%, the increase in NPDP was slowing-down two weeks after BPI, and subsequent NPDD was only 15% compared with those with higher positive rates, which suggested that the situation of testing might have affected the velocity of COVID-19 spread. The causes behind remarkable differences between regions possibly include genetic factors of inhabitants because distributions of the race and of the observed infection increasing rates were in good agreement globally.

Modeling large-scale live video streaming client behavior	MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Adaptive live streaming; Large-scale event; Internet measurements; Workload characterization; User behavior		The live streaming of large-scale events over the Internet attracts a highly diverse audience. Despite the progress in streaming technologies, which employ adaptive bitrate to dynamically adjust the streaming of individual clients to reflect their resource availability, content providers still struggle to efficiently match provisioned capacity and demand in such events. In this paper, we present an in-depth characterization and modeling of client behavior during the live streaming of the 2018 FIFA World Soccer Cup. We analyze logs covering more than 60 million streaming sessions collected from servers of one of the major content providers in Latin America. We characterize key features of the workload, such as the number and duration of sessions as well as transmission quality (i.e., bitrate), shedding new light on the workload of a major content provider during a unique large-scale streaming event. We then propose a simple hierarchical model to describe the typical behavior of individual clients both at the session and video bitrate adaptation layers. Taking a step further, we employ non-supervised clustering to identify classes of client behavior and generate specialized models, one for each class. Our evaluation shows that the specialized models are more accurate compared to the single general model, as it can better describe the diversity of client behavior patterns.

Fuzzy Logic for Omnidirectional Mobile Platform Control Displacement using FPGA and Bluetooth Communication Devices	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st Congress of the Chilean-Association-of-Automatic Control (ACCA) / 20th Conference of the Collaboration-Researchers-International-Working-Group (CRIWG)	2014	Santiago, CHILE	Chilean Assoc Automat Control, Collaborat Researchers Int Working Grp		Fuzzy Logic; FPGA; Omnidirectional platform; VHDL		The article shows an omnidirectional mobile platform control using the artificial intelligence techinique of Fuzzy Logic; the control allows a practical and reliable driving control of 4 omnidirectional wheels. The control module is implemented in FPGA allowing having an independent and autonomous single chip system out of a central computer dependence to be used in different applications like service robots platforms. An additional feature is performed by using Bluetooth communication with a cellular phone as the handset control device. Driving movements for the mobile platform is limited for eight directions, a Fuzzy Logic module controls the travelling of the platform with independent movements for each wheel, physical feedback is implemented by using electronic decoders, and experimental results were achieved with an additional feature of a handset device control based on a smartphone OS Android with Bluetooth communication. Not using external software and having a system using an artificial intelligence technique implemented in fast hardware, gives the system robust and reliable control capabilities.

Design: Prospective, multi-center sub-study. Setting: Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network Cohort (ECHORN) Study, with study sites in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados. Participants: Community-residing adults without a diagnosis of HTN and not taking antihypertensive medication. Intervention: Ambulatory BP patterns are assessed using 24-hour ABPM. Contextual factors are assessed with: ecological momentary assessment (7-item survey of experiences, exposures and responses associated with daytime BP measurements); actigraphy (capturing physical activity and sleep quality); and self-report surveys (assessing physical and social health, environmental and social stressors and supports). Main Outcome Measures: Phenotypes of contextual factors associated with hypertensive BP patterns (sustained HTN, masked HTN, and nocturnal non-dipping) Methods and Results: This study will enroll 500 participants; assessments of blood pressure and contextual factors will be conducted during Waves 2 and 3 of the ECHORN parent study, occurring 2 years apart. In Wave 2, we will assess the association between contextual factors and ABPM patterns. Using advanced analytic clustering methods, we will identify phenotypes of contextual factors associated with hypertensive ABPM patterns. We will then test the stability of these phenotypes and their ability to predict change in ABPM patterns between Waves 2 and 3. Conclusions: Assessment of ABPM, and the contextual factors influencing ABPM, can identify unique phenotypes of HTN, which can then be used to develop more precision-based approaches to the prevention, detection and treatment of HTN in high-risk populations.

The Woman of Colour and Adventures in Stylometry	EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FICTION			English	Article								This essay explores the methods of computational analysis for authorship attribution (stylometry), using The Woman of Colour as a case study. It compares the novel against a corpus of British women writers and a corpus of texts with Caribbean authors or themes. It examines the biases and limits of these methods from the perspective of both statistics and literature, by exploring the concepts of authorship, writing style, prevalence, sample size, and machine learning algorithms. This exploration of stylometric methods is relevant because many eighteenth-century novels were published anonymously and because of the increasing availability of and scholarly interest in digital analysis of texts and authorship attribution, especially for texts by women and minority writers.

BRNeural - Artificial Neural Networks Simulator with Topology Multilayer Perceptron Using the Encog Framework	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Networks; agriculture; agrometeorological data		The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach has had been applied in solutions for several problems such as classification, prediction and pattern recognition. Mostly, these problems belong to diversified areas of knowledge, not necessarily related to Computer Science, e.g. in agriculture, specifically in precision agriculture, recognition of diseases in plants, among others. Therefore, it is possible to visualize the multidisciplinary feature that ANNs have, motivating the development of tools for simulating more generic ANN, making its use possible by users whose knowledge of this type of methodology isn't deep. Inside this context, the just described work has had the goal of developing a tool that is part of the BRNeural research project, whose main goal was the development of a simulator named BRNeural (Brasil Neural) which is focused on the scientific and professional community since one of its proposals is to offer a generic environment to aid the creation, train and operate with ANNs. This tool consists in a module for training and testing ANNs with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) topology and it was developed using the ENCOG framework. For validating this module and all implemented training algorithms, the simulator was submitted to pattern recognition tests using agrometeorological data such as temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind direction, wind speed and temperature of leaf wetness, comparing the results obtained with another simulator which was developed using the MLP framework (Medeiros, 2003) with the specific purpose of classifying diseases in severity indexes. After validating, the simulator was submitted to other pattern recognition tests whose goal was the classification of diseases in the wheat like Blight, Spot blotch and Mildew in severity indexes through agrometeorological variables, showing its features such as output normalizations and the training algorithms Backpropagation, Resilient propagation and Quick propagation. The best results were obtained with the tests for the classification of diseases using severity indexes, 83.63% correct answers for Blight using the Quick propagation training algorithm and Equilateral normalization, 86.95% of correct answers for Mildew with Resilient Propagation algorithm and OneOf normalization and, for Spot blotch, 91.96% correct answers with Quick and Resilient Propagation algorithms, both using Equilateral normalization.

Here, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and mortality risk factors in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients from Mexico. For this purpose, we recruited 67 consecutive mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients which were grouped according to their clinical outcome (survival vs. death). Clinical risk factors for mortality were identified by machine-learning and logistic regression models. The median age of participants was 42 years and 65% were men. The most common comorbidity observed was obesity (49.2%). Fever was the most frequent symptom of illness (88%), followed by dyspnea (84%). Multilobe ground-glass opacities were observed in 76% of patients by thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan. Fifty-two percent of study participants were ventilated in prone position, and 59% required cardiovascular support with norepinephrine. Furthermore, 49% of participants were coinfected with a second pathogen. Two-thirds of COVID-19 patients developed acute kidney injury (AKIN). The mortality of our cohort was 44.7%. AKIN, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and a longitudinal increase in the ventilatory ratio were associated with mortality. Baseline PaO2/FiO2 values and a longitudinal recovery of lymphocytes were protective factors against mortality. Our study provides reference data about the clinical phenotype and risk factors for mortality in mechanically ventilated Mexican patients with COVID-19.</p>	[Hernandez-Cardenas, Carmen M.; Torruco-Sotelo, Carlos; Jurado, Felipe; Serna-Secundino, Hector; Aguilar, Cristina; Garcia-Olazaran, Jose G.; Hernandez-Garcia, Diana; Lugo-Goytia, Gustavo] Inst Nacl Enfermedades Resp Ismael Cosio Villegas, Resp Intens Care Unit, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Alberto Choreno-Parra, Jose; Zuniga, Joaquin] Inst Nacl Enfermedades Resp Ismael Cosio Villegas, Lab Immunobiol & Genet, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Alberto Choreno-Parra, Jose] Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Choreno-Parra, Eduardo M.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Zuniga, Joaquin] Escuela Med & Ciencias Salud, Tecnol Monterrey, Mexico City, DF, Mexico		Lugo-Goytia, G (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Enfermedades Resp Ismael Cosio Villegas, Resp Intens Care Unit, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.; Zuniga, J (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Enfermedades Resp Ismael Cosio Villegas, Lab Immunobiol & Genet, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.; Zuniga, J (corresponding author), Escuela Med & Ciencias Salud, Tecnol Monterrey, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.	joazu@yahoo.com; lugogoy@yahoo.com.mx	Choreño-Parra, José Alberto/ABB-2062-2021		Institutional research funds of INER; National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) under the Secretaria de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion de la Ciudad de Mexico (SECTEI CDMX) [SECTEI/050/2020]; Fondo Institucional de Fomento Regional para el Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico y de Innovacion (FORDECYT) [FORDECYT/10SE/2020/05/14-06, FORDECYT/10SE/2020/05/14-07]; CONACyT [CVU 737347]	Institutional research funds of INER; National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) under the Secretaria de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion de la Ciudad de Mexico (SECTEI CDMX); Fondo Institucional de Fomento Regional para el Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico y de Innovacion (FORDECYT); CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))	This work was supported by the Institutional research funds of INER, and also received funding from the National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) under the research contracts: SECTEI/050/2020, Secretaria de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion de la Ciudad de Mexico (SECTEI CDMX); FORDECYT/10SE/2020/05/14-06 and FORDECYT/10SE/2020/05/14-07 from the Fondo Institucional de Fomento Regional para el Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico y de Innovacion (FORDECYT).

Nevertheless, the CNN computational complexity is considerable larger than classic algorithms, thus, CPU- or GPU-based platforms are generally used for CNN implementations in many applications, but often do not fulfill portable requirements due to resources, energy and real-time constrains. Therefore, there is a growing interest on real time processing solutions for object recognition using CNNs mainly implemented on embedded systems, which are limited both in resources and energy consumption. An updated review of prominent reported approaches for mapping CNNs onto embedded systems is described in this paper. Two main solutions trends for reducing the hardware CNN workload are distinguished through a deduced taxonomy. One is focused on algorithm level solutions to reduce the number of multiplications and CNN coefficients. On the other hand, hardware level solutions goal is to achieve processing time, power consumption and hardware resources reduction. Two dominant hardware level design strategies are pointed out as oriented to either reducing the energy consumption and resources utilization meeting real-time requirements or increasing the throughput at the expense of resources utilization. Finally, two identified design strategies for CNN hardware accelerators are proposed as opportunity research areas.

This work presents a pattern model, which is capable of providing the characteristic of directionality to a non-directional overcurrent relay that is installed on a transmission line by monitoring the current signal only, without the reference signal. In addition, a second model which has the ability to identify the type of fault occurred in the protected line is presented. The electrical test system was implemented in ATP/EMTP program, and simulations were driven by a MATLAB program for several short-circuit fault types at different distances.

The democratisation of artificial intelligence, the sprawling application of robotics, the Internet of things, additive manufacturing, nanotechnology, and blockchain are some of the technologies transforming manufacturing processes. They enable the creation of novel products and services, changing business models that are destroying traditional industrial paradigms and value chains. Established economic regions risk losing industrial leadership, technology obsolescence, and the relocation of employment positions, ultimately affecting their economic development. The threat to remain locked in low-value activities demands for coordinated efforts of an Innovation Penta Helix Strategy consisting of 1) industry, 2) academia, 3) government, 4) entrepreneurs, and 5) risk capital aligned in a single vision to create an innovation ecosystem capable of exploiting the benefit of the emerging technological wave. Nuevo Leon 4.0 is a regional strategy developed in the State of Nuevo Leon, Mexico, to position the State of Nuevo Leon as the leader of industry 4.0 in Latin America and built initially on a Triple Helix structure with support from the local Government, managed by the local Industry and empowered by local Academia. The strategy has evolved into a Penta Helix system incorporating Entrepreneurs and Venture Capital to trigger a steady demand for novel technologies within the regional economic Ecosystem, resulting in a growing number of technology startups nurtured by risk capital in the region. The work here presented describes the evolution of the Nuevo Leon 4.0 program from a Triple Helix into a Penta Helix, its organisation model, management and execution practices, the strategy roadmap, and the results achieved during the first two years of operation along with a series of recommendations born out of the experience of the executioners of Nuevo Leon 4.0.

In Ecuador, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 29 February 2020. Despite efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 overran the Ecuadorian public health system, which became one of the most affected in Latin America on 24 April 2020. The Hospital General del Sur de Quito (HGSQ) had to transition from a general to a specific COVID-19 health center in a short period of time to fulfill the health demand from patients with respiratory afflictions. Here, we summarized the implementations applied in the HGSQ to become a COVID-19 exclusive hospital, including the rearrangement of hospital rooms and a triage strategy based on a severity score calculated through an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted chest computed tomography (CT). Moreover, we present clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data from 75 laboratory tested COVID-19 patients, which represent the first outbreak of Quito city. The majority of patients were male with a median age of 50 years. We found differences in laboratory parameters between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU cases considering C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocytes. Sensitivity and specificity of the AI-assisted chest CT were 21.4% and 66.7%, respectively, when considering a score >70%; regardless, this system became a cornerstone of hospital triage due to the lack of RT-PCR testing and timely results. If health workers act as vectors of SARS-CoV-2 at their domiciles, they can seed outbreaks that might put 1,879,047 people at risk of infection within 15 km around the hospital. Despite our limited sample size, the information presented can be used as a local example that might aid future responses in low and middle-income countries facing respiratory transmitted epidemics.

This work relates the concept of small world network in the area of Education Sciences in particular in the integration of teaching cloister in the world system of higher education. A relation is established with micro-world and nanoworld concepts defined in previous works and the term of constellations of small worlds is defined, which allows to group subsets of the network that we analyze. It is concluded that the concept of small world network can be understood in the integration of teaching cloisters to the world system of higher education, which would allow to increase the quality of teaching and research work in Latin America.

To this end, the article engages with Caribbean critic Sylvia Wynter and Asian American writer Margaret Rhee, whose works illuminate human linguistic practice as decolonial and queering modes of engendering and inhabiting the more-than-human world. First, this article attempts a decolonialist intervention into posthumanist performativity in conversation with Wynter's theory of homo narrans, and especially her hypothesis on the cybernetic autopoiesis of diverse cosmogonies. Then, the article discusses Margaret Rhee's poetry Robot, Love (2017) and her Kimchi Poetry Machine project (debut 2014), which engage with poetry as an intimate interaction between human and machine against a backdrop of the queer genealogy of artificial intelligence and the fractured affinities between robots and Asian Americans. In conclusion, this article calls for a decolonial approach to posthuman linguistic performativity, which is less a territory for securing humanity than a decolonial and diasporic feminist technology of listening to difference - which I call cosmo-poetics.

The species are similar morphologically and in the trophic levels from which they feed within each location. In contrast, we detect reliable differences in trophic position amongst the regions. Trophic position appears to decline as the intensity of commercial fishing increases, and is at its lowest in the Caribbean. The spatial gradient in trophic position we document in these regions exceeds those detected over specimens from the last 130 years in the Hawaiian Islands. Modeling suggests that climate velocity and human impacts on fish populations strongly align with these differences.

J	Arellano-Verdejo, J; Lazcano-Hernandez, HE				Arellano-Verdejo, Javier; Lazcano-Hernandez, Hugo E.			Collective view: mapping Sargassum distribution along beaches	PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Crowdsourcing; Convolutional neural networks; Artificial intelligence; Beach monitoring; GIS; Ecological application; Crowd-mapping; Geotagged images		The atypical arrival of pelagic Sargassum to the Mexican Caribbean beaches has caused considerable economic and ecological damage. Furthermore, it has raised new challenges for monitoring the coastlines. Historically, satellite remote-sensing has been used for Sargassum monitoring in the ocean; nonetheless, limitations in the temporal and spatial resolution of available satellite platforms do not allow for near real-time monitoring of this macro-algae on beaches. This study proposes an innovative approach for monitoring Sargassum on beaches using Crowdsourcing for imagery collection, deep learning for automatic classification, and geographic information systems for visualizing the results. We have coined this collaborative process "Collective View". It offers a geotagged dataset of images illustrating the presence or absence of Sargassum on beaches located along the northern and eastern regions in the Yucatan Peninsula, in Mexico. This new dataset is the largest of its kind in surrounding areas. As part of the design process for Collective View, three convolutional neural networks (LeNet-5, AlexNet and VGG16) were modified and retrained to classify images, according to the presence or absence of Sargassum. Findings from this study revealed that AlexNet demonstrated the best performance, achieving a maximum recall of 94%. These results are good considering that the training was carried out using a relatively small set of unbalanced images. Finally, this study provides a first approach to mapping the Sargassum distribution along the beaches using the classified geotagged images and offers novel insight into how we can accurately map the arrival of algal blooms along the coastline.

Artificial Neural Network for Classification and Analysis of Degraded Soils	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Soil physics; Artificial intelligence; Recovery of soil; Intelligent systems	GREEN MANURE; RECLAMATION; RECOVERY; GYPSUM; OXISOL	This study aimed to evaluate the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to establish a classification and analysis of degraded soils and its recovery in response to lime and gypsum application. The analyzed degraded soil was classified as Oxisol, and the physical attributes considered were: soil density, soil porosity (macroporosity and microporosity) and soil penetration resistance. The ANN used in this study is the backpropagation composed of two layers, the middle layer and the output layer, with supervised training. The network has four inputs, that are the physical attributes of the soil, in the middle layer the network contains ten neurons and the output layer only one neuron, which has the function of informing if the soil was recovered (R), partially recovered (PR) or not recovered (NR). The analyzed data come from the year 2012, concerning the depths 0.0 - 0.1 m, 0.1 - 0.2 m and 0.2 - 0.4 m. Considering the performance of ANN, it was verified that the network obtained an adequate training to classify the degraded soils, showing low mean square error of analyzed data. Therefore, ANN is considered an interesting alternative and a powerful automatic tool to classify degraded soils during recovery process.	[Bonini Neto, A.; Bisi, B. S.; Coletta, L. F.

Artificial Vision Techniques for Strawberry's Industrial Classification	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural networks; Image processing; Machine vision		This research presents novel artificial vision techniques applied to the detection of features for strawberries used in the food industry. For this purpose, a computer vision system based in artificial neural networks is used, organized as a deep architecture and trained with noise compensated learning. This combination originates a strong network - object relations which makes possible the recognition of complex strawberry features under changing conditions of lightning, size and orientation. The programming uses OpenCV libraries and fruits databases captured with a webcam. The images used to train the Artificial Neural Network are defined with canny edge detection and a moving region of interest (ROI). After training, the network recognizes important features such as shape, color and anomalies. The system has been tested in real time with real images.

Online Orthogonal Regression Based on a Regularized Squared Loss	2018 17TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS (ICMLA)			English	Proceedings Paper	17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (IEEE ICMLA)	DEC 17-20, 2018	Orlando, FL	IEEE, Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat		Orthogonal regression; Online learning; Kernel	ALGORITHMS; ERRORS; STATISTICS	Orthogonal regression extends the classical regression framework by assuming that the data may contain errors in both the dependent and independent variables. Often, this approach tends to outperform classical regression in real-world scenarios. However, the algorithms used to determine a solution to the orthogonal regression problem require the computation of singular value decompositions (SVD), which may be computationally expensive and impractical for real-world problems. In this work, we propose a new approach to the orthogonal regression problem based on a regularized squared loss. The method follows an online learning strategy which makes it more flexible for different types of applications. The algorithm is derived in primal and dual variables and the later formulation allows the introduction of kernels for nonlinear modeling. We compare our proposed orthogonal regression algorithm to a corresponding classical regression algorithm using both synthetic and real-world datasets from different applications. Our algorithm achieved better results for most of the datasets.	[Souza, Roberto C. S. N.

A Survey on Class Imbalance Learning on Automatic Visual Inspection	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Automatic visual inspection; Class imbalance learning; Classifiers ensemble; Cost-sensitive learning; One Class Classification	DEFECT DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; VISION; SMOTE	The supervised machine learning has been showing very useful for the automatic visual inspection task. However, little has been considered about use traditional machine learning techniques on a domain where the classes are imbalanced. This problem corresponds to dealing with the situation where one class outnumbers the other. Traditional machine learning algorithms trained with imbalance datasets can be biased towards the majority class, thus producing poor predictive accuracy over the minority class. In this paper, we present different approaches to address the class imbalance problem and how these approaches have been used in the context of automatic visual inspection. The literature shows there are few works that consider the class imbalance problem on automatic visual inspection task and it shows that the one class classification technique is the most used.

Predictive Modeling for Perinatal Mortality in Resource-Limited Settings	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article							BIRTH-WEIGHT; NEONATAL-MORTALITY; GESTATIONAL-AGE; NEWBORN; RISK; CARE; STILLBIRTHS; PRETERM; HEALTH; INCOME	This cohort study evaluates the accuracy of a machine learning-based model to predict risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Importance The overwhelming majority of fetal and neonatal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Fetal and neonatal risk assessment tools may be useful to predict the risk of death. Objective To develop risk prediction models for intrapartum stillbirth and neonatal death. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study used data from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research population-based vital registry, including clinical sites in South Asia (India and Pakistan), Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and Kenya), and Latin America (Guatemala). A total of 502 648 pregnancies were prospectively enrolled in the registry. Exposures Risk factors were added sequentially into the data set in 4 scenarios: (1) prenatal, (2) predelivery, (3) delivery and day 1, and (4) postdelivery through day 2. Main Outcomes and Measures Data sets were randomly divided into 10 groups of 3 analysis data sets including training (60%), test (20%), and validation (20%). Conventional and advanced machine learning modeling techniques were applied to assess predictive abilities using area under the curve (AUC) for intrapartum stillbirth and neonatal mortality. Results All prenatal and predelivery models had predictive accuracy for both intrapartum stillbirth and neonatal mortality with AUC values 0.71 or less. Five of 6 models for neonatal mortality based on delivery/day 1 and postdelivery/day 2 had increased predictive accuracy with AUC values greater than 0.80. Birth weight was the most important predictor for neonatal death in both postdelivery scenarios with independent predictive ability with AUC values of 0.78 and 0.76, respectively. The addition of 4 other top predictors increased AUC to 0.83 and 0.87 for the postdelivery scenarios, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Models based on prenatal or predelivery data had predictive accuracy for intrapartum stillbirths and neonatal mortality of AUC values 0.71 or less. Models that incorporated delivery data had good predictive accuracy for risk of neonatal mortality. Birth weight was the most important predictor for neonatal mortality. Question Can prenatal and postdelivery variables accurately predict the risk of stillbirth and neonatal deaths in resource-limited settings of low- and middle-income countries? Findings Using advanced machine learning-based modeling techniques on a large multicountry prospective maternal and neonatal database, this cohort study found that the prediction accuracy of models for risk of stillbirth and neonatal death using variables before delivery is low, but the prediction accuracy for neonatal death can be improved by including postdelivery variables. Birth weight was the most important predictor of neonatal mortality. Meaning Models that include postdelivery variables have good prediction accuracy for neonatal deaths.

Dynamic Vulnerability Assessment due to Transient Instability based on Data Mining Analysis for Smart Grid Applications	2011 IEEE PES CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIVE SMART GRID TECHNOLOGIES LATIN AMERICA (ISGT LA)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE-PES Conference on Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Latin America (ISGT LA)	OCT 19-21, 2011	Medellin, COLOMBIA	IEEE Power & Energy Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Colombia Sect		Data Mining; MSSA; Pattern Recognition; Phasor measurement units; Security; Smart Grids; SVM; Transient Stability; Vulnerability Assessment		In recent years, some Smart Grid applications have been designed in order to perform timely Self-Healing and adaptive reconfiguration actions based on system-wide analysis, with the objective of reducing the risk of power system blackouts. Real time dynamic vulnerability assessment (DVA) has to be done in order to decide and coordinate the appropriate corrective control actions, depending on the event evolution. This paper presents a novel approach for carrying out real time DVA, focused on Transient Stability Assessment (TSA), based on some time series data mining techniques (Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis MSSA, and Principal Component Analysis PCA), and a machine learning tool (Support Vector Machine Classifier SVM-C). In addition, a general overview of the state of the art of the methods to perform vulnerability assessment, with emphasis in the potential use of PMUs for post-contingency DVA, is described. The developed methodology is tested in the IEEE 39 bus New England test system, where the simulated cause of vulnerability is transient instability. The results show that time series data mining tools are useful to find hidden patterns in electric signals, and SVM-C can use those patterns for effectively classifying the system vulnerability status.

However, there is no Standardized Methodology under which such mobile applications are built. This research aims to propose a set of guidelines and techniques that facilitate the design and construction of web-based mobile applications for mobile devices. In order to achieve this objective, a methodology is proposed which consists of experimenting with source collections, designed for PC web pages, making an evaluation and carrying out a standardization, so that in the end valid guidelines are obtained for learning objects based on web for mobile devices. We cite theoretical references PMBOK, KANBAN, SCRUM. In conclusion, it was possible to propose a methodological guide that covers the necessary techniques and guidelines that allow the good design and construction of mobile applications of high quality oriented to m-learning, guaranteeing the success and acceptance of the end user.

But current solutions, mostly based on artificial neural networks do not always meet end users requirements on the readability and the understandability of predictive models. In this paper, we present a new version of our original solution based on the concept of aggregate variables in order to predict flash flood events from observed water level and/or rain measurements, particularly in the context of caribbean watersheds in which flash flood are much uncertain. We combine aggregate variables in juries. Juries of aggregate variables are trained and tested using a typical 10-fold cross validation scheme. Best juries are searched through an evolutionary approach that is optimized. Different parameters are set up like aggregation periods and jury sizes to prove the efficiency of the proposed approach compared to classical solutions.

We test the methods of simple average, weighted average, neural networks, and ANFIS for combining expert forecasts. The combining system is used for streamflow prediction with horizons of one, three and six months ahead. We found that the combination of forecasts using ANFIS outperforms the accuracy of each individual model and the composed forecasts obtained using the other combining techniques.	[Rojo, J.

This article proposes a machine learning, hierarchical object-based method to map slum settlements using very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and land boundary data to support slum upgrading. The proposed method is tested in Kingston Metropolitan Area, Jamaica. First, the VHR imagery is classified into major land cover classes (i.e., the initial land cover map). Second, the VHR imagery and land boundary layer are used to obtain homogenous neighborhoods (HNs). Third, the initial land cover map is used to derive multiple context, spectral, and texture image features according to the local physical characteristics of slum settlements. Fourth, a machine-learning classifier, classification and regression trees, is used to classify HNs into slum and nonslum settlements using only the effective image features. Finally, reference data collected manually are used to assess the accuracy of the classification. In the training site, an overall accuracy of 0.935 is achieved. The effective image indicators for slum mapping include the building layout, building density, building roof characteristics, and distance from buildings to gullies. The classifier and those features selected from the training site are further used to map slums in two validating sites to assess the transferability of our approach. Overall accuracy of the two validating sites reached 0.928 and 0.929, respectively, suggesting that the features and classification model obtained from one site has the potential to be transferred to other areas in Jamaica and possibly other developing Caribbean countries with similar situation and data availability.

An Intelligent Decision Support System to Investment in the Stock Market	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Decision Support System; Artificial Intelligence; Stock Market; Expert Systems; Forecasting Models		Stock market is a type of investment where with proper strategies and caution you can get good returns. However, its complex and stochastic behavior, the lack of knowledge and possibility of losses, can prevent a greater number of people availing themselves of this source of financial gain. The use of intelligent computational strategies can help the investor in this decision. From this viewpoint, this paper proposes an intelligent hybrid system that combines forecasting techniques with heuristic rules to give subsidies to the investor in the transaction in the stock market. To show functionality of the system we performed several studies in which we can close that the information provided by the system gave the investor possibility of higher gain ($) as well as an efficient capture trends of the stock market.

The optimization in islanded mode aims to maximize the provision of the loads while following a list of priorities, which is set by the user. Controllable loads can be dragged within the priority list according to the user's preferences. Loads and groups of loads take priority among others according to their position on the list. In addition, the user may set preferences according to: the loads and groups of loads' supply options; the amount of energy that must be saved as a backup during connected mode in order to being able to meet selected loads in an occasional islanded mode; and which loads should be automatically shut down in the islanded mode. We present a mathematical model to describe these options, as well as simulations and results.	[Gloria, Luna L.; Costa, Gabriel H. S.; Oliveira, Debora B.

Moreover, VSIs have been described as products of inequality designed to segregate and hinder integration between public and private urban spaces. This study assesses VSIs across six cities in Brazil, a country notable for its profound inequality and sociospatial fragmentation. The main aims of this research are: (i) to develop and test a predictive model for VSIs using socioeconomic indicators drawn from open-source ground-truth data; (ii) to identify the variance of VSI within selected case studies. In the development phase of the predictive model, data from the city of Recife are used to build the model. The testing phase involves the analysis of VSIs in the cities of Fortaleza, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba and Porto Alegre. The model can potentially assist urban planners in better understanding and locating VSIs and mitigating undesirable outcomes.

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a common architecture for solving the Language Modeling task in a self-supervised way. VAE consists of a concept of latent variables inside the model. Latent variables are described as a random variable that is fit by the data. Up to now, in the majority of cases, latent variables are considered normally distributed. The normal distribution is a well-known distribution that can be easily included in any pipeline. Moreover, the normal distribution is a good choice when the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds. It makes it effective when one is working with i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) random variables. However, the conditions of CLT in Natural Language Processing are not easy to check. So, the choice of distribution family is unclear in the domain. This paper studies the priors selection impact of continuous distributions in the Low-Resource Language Modeling task with VAE. The experiment shows that there is a statistical difference between the different priors in the encoder-decoder architecture. We showed that family distribution hyperparameter is important in the Low-Resource Language Modeling task and should be considered for the model training.

Inducing Decision Trees based on a Cluster Quality Index	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						supervised classification; decision trees; validation indexes; rand statistic; gain ratio; gini index	CRITERION; SELECTION	Decision trees are popular classifiers in data mining, artificial intelligence, and pattern recognition, because they are accurate and easy to comprehend. In this paper, we introduce a new procedure for inducing decision trees, to obtain trees that are more accurate, more compact, and more balanced. Each candidate split is evaluated using Rand Statistics, a quality index based on external measures, because it is considered by many authors as the best existing index. Our method was compared with other state-of-the-art methods and the results over 30 databases from the UCI Repository prove our claims. We also introduce a new equation to measure the balance of a binary tree.	[Loyola, O.] Ctr Bioplantas, Modesto Reyes, Ciego De Avila, Cuba; [Medina, M.

In a world driven by a new wave of technological change, the platform would revalue the role of think tanks, research institutions and knowledge hubs to move the global agenda in an issue of central importance for the future of society: the creation of the jobs of the future. Building on and complementing existing experiences, the T20 platform would be a digital hub for producing knowledge, informing policies and connecting potential partners to accelerate the jobs of the future, within the context of an increasing integrated global economy. It would also contribute to the development of consensual views among the research community, allowing to discard extreme visions about the jobs of the future, dispelling both overly optimistic visions with no evidence base and unwarranted fears.

All of them were constructed using two hidden layers, a back-propagation algorithm for the learning process, and a logistic function as a nonlinear transfer function. In order to explore different arrays for neurons into hidden layers, we performed the bootstrap technique for each neural network and selected the one with the least Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value. We also compared these results with pedotransfer functions and another neural networks from the literature. The results show that our artificial neural networks obtained from 0.0459 to 0.0413 in the RMSE measurement, and 0.9725 to 0.9780 for R2, which are in good agreement with other works. We also found that reducing the amount of the input data offered us better results.

However, when to be used in certain domains and environments, 3APL has some limitations related to its simplistic update operator that only allows for updates to the extensional part of the belief base and its lack of a language with both default and strong negation to enable the representation and reasoning about knowledge with the open and closed world assumptions. In this paper, we propose to address these issues by modifying the belief base of 3APL to be represented by Dynamic Logic Programming, an extension of Answer-Set Programming that allows for the representation of knowledge that changes with time.

Visual Analysis to Generate and Validate Geographical Heuristics	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						visualizations; visual inspection; geographical heuristics; machine learning	SEGREGATION; CHILE	The popularity of smartphones has opened endless possibilities for researchers. The adoption of these devices by all kind of users has transformed each one of them into a mobile sensor that can measure different types of data. These data can eventually be transmitted via Internet to servers where it can be studied to understand different aspects of the environment and human behavior in ways that were not possible a few years ago. Even with all this information available, the granularity of the data can be coarse, and the amount of it can be scarce, making it difficult to study and evaluate such data. This is especially true for certain geographically-related problems, where conventional algorithms are difficult to design. For these problems it is possible to design heuristics to reach a good approximation, however the methodology to assess the effectiveness of such heuristics is unclear. In this paper we present our work towards a methodology to generate and evaluate such heuristics. This methodology is based on displaying geographical information visually so human evaluators can judge the quality of the heuristic and combining it with the calculation power of computers.

Yet, traditional fMRI research on resting-state networks (RSNs) has favored static and average connectivity methods, which by overlooking the fluctuation dynamics triggered by neurodegeneration, have yielded inconsistent results. The present multicenter study introduces a data-driven machine learning pipeline based on dynamic connectivity fluctuation analysis (DCFA) on RS-fMRI data from 300 participants belonging to three groups: behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and healthy controls. We considered non-linear oscillatory patterns across combined and individual resting-state networks (RSNs), namely: the salience network (SN), mostly affected in bvFTD; the default mode network (DMN), mostly affected in AD; the executive network (EN), partially compromised in both conditions; the motor network (MN); and the visual network (VN). These RSNs were entered as features for dementia classification using a recent robust machine learning approach (a Bayesian hyperparameter tuned Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) algorithm), across four independent datasets with different MR scanners and recording parameters. The machine learning classification accuracy analysis revealed a systematic and unique tailored architecture of RSN disruption. The classification accuracy ranking showed that the most affected networks for bvFTD were the SN + EN network pair (mean accuracy = 86.43%, AUC = 0.91, sensitivity = 86.45%, specificity = 87.54%); for AD, the DMN + EN network pair (mean accuracy = 86.63%, AUC = 0.89, sensitivity = 88.37%, specificity = 84.62%); and for the bvFTD vs. AD classification, the DMN + SN network pair (mean accuracy = 82.67%, AUC = 0.86, sensitivity = 81.27%, specificity = 83.01%). Moreover, the DFCA classification systematically outperformed canonical connectivity approaches (including both static and linear dynamic connectivity). Our findings suggest that nonlinear dynamical fluctuations surpass two traditional seed-based functional connectivity approaches and provide a pathophysiological characterization of global brain networks in neurodegenerative conditions (AD and bvFTD) across multicenter data.

We developed three specific objectives. First, we designed the architecture of the MAS that manages the resources and activities in a virtual learning environment (VLE), for which we used the related works on MAS in a VLE. Second, we implement the architecture of the MAS, the prototype proposed has been called GREAC (Gestion de Recursos y Actividades), which considers the learning style (LS) of the student to manage the resources and activities in an adaptive way, and uses the methodology Prometheus, Moodle 3.6 (VLE), and the framework Jade, for the development of the prototype of the MAS. Third, we evaluated the prototype GREAC in a SaCI in an academic context. In the evaluation participated 54 students from the Universidad Nacional de Loja, of the Carrera de Ingenieria en Sistemas. As a result of the evaluation by the students, we obtained a level of satisfaction 92.6 %. Finally, this work concludes that the implementation of a MAS in a VLE allows the dynamic management of resources and activities, taking into account the students LS, allowing an adaptive and personalized management.

The growing adoption of CNNs in safety-critical embedded systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles) increases the demand for safe and reliable models. In this sense, this brief investigates the soft error reliability of two CNN inference models considering single event upsets (SEUs) occurring in register files, RAM, and Flash memory sections. The results show that the incidence of SEUs in flash memory sections tend to lead to more critical faults than those resulting from the occurrence of bit-flips in RAM sections and register files.

It is our view that the goals of an agent can be seen as a knowledge base of the situations that it wants to achieve. It is therefore in a natural way that we use Dynamic Logic Programming (DLP), an extension of AnswerSet Programming that allows for the representation of knowledge that changes with time, to represent the goals of the agent and their evolution, in a simple, declarative, fashion. In this paper, we represent agent's goals as a DLP, discuss and show how to represent some situations where the agent should adopt or drop goals, and investigate some properties that emerge from using such representation.

We aimed to carry out a quantitative assessment of the link between reef coral traits and species extinction risk informed by extinctions of reef corals observed in the fossil record. Location Global. Time period Plio-Pleistocene and present day. Major taxa studied Scleractinian reef corals. Methods We used morphological traits, phylogenetic information and evidence of extinction during the Plio-Pleistocene to predict the extinction risk of contemporary reef corals. Our model was trained using 138 Caribbean fossil coral species and an automatic machine learning algorithm. We then used this model to predict the extinction risk of 674 modern coral species. Results Model validation confirmed 77% accuracy in predicting extinction risk of fossil corals. Extinction risk predicted by our model showed a near-random (57%) match with the IUCN conservation status. Our model also suggested that corals in the Least Concern or Near Threatened categories might be at higher risk of extinction than currently believed. Main conclusions Morphological traits of fossil corals linked to their extinction risk in the Plio-Pleistocene Caribbean Sea are known to reflect the vulnerability of extant corals. However, the results from our fossil-calibrated model do not match the IUCN assessment of reef corals, with increased overall extinction risk. This does not necessarily indicate near-future extinction risk, because fossil extinctions are spread over thousands of years. However, we show the applicability of using fossil data to inform the extinction risk of modern corals and recommend that future assessments of extinction risk of reef corals should consider incorporating the relationship between morphological traits and resilience, calibrated by fossil data, to maximize the utility of the extinction risk assessment.

Transdiagnostic dimensional approaches of interoception (the sensing of visceral signals) may improve the descriptions of cross-pathological symptoms at behavioral, electrophysiological, and anatomical levels. Alterations of cardiac interoception (encompassing multidimensional variables such as accuracy, learning, sensibility, and awareness) and its neural correlates (electrophysiological markers, imaging-based anatomical and functional connectivity) have been proposed as critical across disparate neurological disorders. However, no study has examined the specific impact of neural (relative to autonomic) disturbances of cardiac interoception or their differential manifestations across neurological conditions. Methods Here, we used a computational approach to classify and evaluate which markers of cardiac interoception (behavioral, metacognitive, electrophysiological, volumetric, or functional) offer the best discrimination between neurological conditions and cardiac (hypertensive) disease (model 1), and among neurological conditions (Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, multiple sclerosis, and brain stroke; model 2). In total, the study comprised 52 neurological patients (mean [standard deviation] age = 55.1 [17.3] years; 37 women), 25 cardiac patients (age = 66.2 [9.1] years; 13 women), and 72 healthy controls (age = 52.65 [17.1] years; 50 women). Results Cardiac interoceptive outcomes successfully classified between neurological and cardiac conditions (model 1: >80% accuracy) but not among neurological conditions (model 2: 53% accuracy). Behavioral cardiac interoceptive alterations, although present in all conditions, were powerful in differentiating between neurological and cardiac diseases. However, among neurological conditions, cardiac interoceptive deficits presented more undifferentiated and unspecific disturbances across dimensions. Conclusions Our result suggests a diffuse pattern of interoceptive alterations across neurological conditions, highlighting their potential role as dimensional, transdiagnostic markers.

A major reason for the neglect of less connected nodes in this global urban network is the sparse evidence on their world city formation. Drawing on earlier specifications and measurements of the world city network, the present paper shows how fuzzy set approach and pattern recognition can assess the inherent vagueness in classifications of lower ranked world cities. The resulting taxonomy asserts the intertwining relational tendencies of 234 cities in 20 clusters. Key findings include the distinctive profiles of US cities, the marginal position of (sub-Saharan) African and Central American cities, and Miami's particular role as a gateway between Anglo- and Latin America.

A DEVS Based Methodological Framework for Reinforcement Learning Agent Training	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Markov processes; Training; Reinforcement learning; Silicon compounds; Process control; IEEE transactions; Surges; support for training; RL agents; Reinforcement Learning; DEVS; AI-enabled systems; Artifi		Reinforcement Learning has become one of the fastest growing fields of artificial intelligence due to the successful application of its techniques into several domains. In this way, the integration of intelligent agents based on Reinforcement Learning into information systems is a current reality. However, the way in which they learn requires a simulation model of the process that must be controlled to obtain large volumes of risk-free information. In this work, a methodological framework to support the training of Reinforcement Learning agents using DEVS is proposed. This framework provides the steps and elements required to implement RL Agents with the purpose of accelerating the agent learning and reducing training costs. Also, it allows modeling the dynamics of complex systems in a modular and hierarchical way, favoring the reuse of simulation components, since it is based on DEVS formalims fundamentals.

Improving the estimation accuracy is a widely recognized benefit for several software development processes. In order to achieve these objectives, there are proposals based on Artificial Intelligence techniques and specifically artificial neural networks. This paper proposes an optimization methodology for searching the best neural model applicable to the effort estimation of software projects. This will draw on a set of known factors in the early stages of development, outside the complex calculation of function points, which would entail a high level of maturity and definition of the project.

The technology is termed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and combines the classic field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the representational power of modern Deep Learning approaches. DRL enables solutions for difficult and high dimensional tasks, such as Atari game playing, for which previously proposed RL methods were inadequate. However, these new solution approaches still take a long time to learn how to actuate in such domains and so far are mainly researched for single task scenarios. The ability to generalize gathered knowledge and transfer it to another task has been researched for classical RL, but remains an open problem for the DRL domain. Consequently, in this article we evaluate under which conditions the application of Transfer Learning (TL) to the DRL domain improves the learning of a new task. Our results indicate that TL can greatly accelerate DRL when transferring knowledge from similar tasks, and that the similarity between tasks plays a key role in the success or failure of knowledge transfer.

This paper proposes to use abstract argumentation frameworks to combine such approaches. We extend the Value-based Argumentation Framework (VAF)[2], in order to represent arguments with confidence degrees. Our agents apply individual mapping algorithms and cooperate in order to exchange their local results (arguments). Next, based on their preferences and confidence of the arguments, the agents compute their preferred mapping sets. The arguments in such preferred sets are viewed as the set of globally acceptable arguments.

Moreover, migratory phenomena have spread the infection beyond endemic areas. Efforts for the development of new pharmacological therapies are paramount as the pharmacological profile of the two marketed drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benznidazole, needs to be improved. Cruzain, a parasitic cysteine protease, is one of the most attractive biological targets due to its roles in parasite survival and immune evasion. In this work, we compiled and curated a database of diverse cruzain inhibitors previously reported in the literature. From this data set, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for the prediction of their pIC(50) values were generated using k-nearest neighbors and random forest algorithms. Local and global models were calculated and compared. The statistical parameters for internal and external validation indicate a significant predictability, with q(loo)(2) values around 0.66 and 0.61 and external R-2 coefficients of 0.725 and 0.766. The applicability domain is quantitatively defined, according to QSAR good practices, using the leverage and similarity methods. The models described in this work are readily available in a Python script for the discovery of novel cruzain inhibitors.

In the Amazon, the assessment of the sustainability benefits of using adapted analytical models. However, this model is not always accurate. In this paper we propose a methodology that uses an artificial intelligence algorithm based on artificial neural networks (ANN), as a decision support tool, which aims to classify agroecosystems with agroforestry systems and without agroforestry systems. The sites are classified into two groups: Sustainable and Not Sustainable. For data collection we carried out technical visits to the rural community of Santa Luzia, in the municipality of Tome-Acu, Para Amazon. During the research data of 28 production units were collected. Finally, the data were submitted to the ANN and the results demonstrate the high potential of using computational intelligence algorithms for the purpose of monitoring the agro forestry systems in the Amazon region.

Studies show that globally fish species of commercial importance and their reproduction sites are decreasing at an alarming rate. In Honduras there is little information on these reproduction sites, marine biology analysts have determined that it is of crucial importance to monitor these sites. Obtaining video recordings of the FSA's is vital to study and monitoring efforts, however it turns out to be very time consuming. This study proposes a neural network capable of the detection, classification, and counting of 11 fish species indicatives of reproductive activity at FSA. With this implementation it will be possible to dedicate more time to communication and socialization of the knowledge obtain to local authorities and fishermen, reduce personnel cost, and allow for the inclusion of innovative and technological solutions. Using the Incremental methodology, the Caribbean Fish database of 387 images is created for the training process of the neural network using YOLOv4 and Darknet as infrastructure and architecture respectively with an experimental approach. After 3 stages of training and testing, the object detector and classifier obtained a mAP of 88.1% and average retention of 80%. The network shows that is very capable of complying with the requirements of the monitoring process of fish reproduction sites through video recordings.

To meet the scale and scope of this challenge, we propose designing and demonstrating a multi-modal system that can incorporate data from remote sensing (satellites, aircraft, and aerial drones), acoustics, genetics, sensor arrays, and low-cost imaging systems. The latter will be collected by low-cost smart sensing and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) guided by adaptive sampling modeling software and rapidly analyzed using automated machine learning systems. Development and deployment will be linked to extensive and diversity-enhancing training programs. The Coral Sentinel System will be globally deployed to enable rapid-response adaptive management and to build public engagement in conservation interventions to save coral reefs. Phase 1 (Year 1) will involve testing assumptions, coalition building, fundraising, and initial system development. Phase 2 (Years 2-4) will focus on engineering and development with a pilot deployment in the Caribbean. Phase 3 (Years 5-6) will involve system expansion and iteration along the Tropical Eastern Pacific corridor. Phase 4 (Years 7-10) will involve global deployment to over 50 reef sites. This will lead during the following decade (Phase 5) to provisioning of low-cost Sentinel systems to coastal communities globally.

A hybrid genetic algorithm-extreme learning machine approach for accurate significant wave height reconstruction	OCEAN MODELLING			English	Article						Significant wave height local reconstruction; Extreme learning machines; Support vector regression; Gaussian process regression; Genetic algorithm	INFORMATION; MODEL	Wave parameters computed from time series measured by buoys (significant wave height H-s, mean wave period, etc.) play a key role in coastal engineering and in the design and operation of wave energy converters. Storms or navigation accidents can make measuring buoys break down, leading to missing data gaps. In this paper we tackle the problem of locally reconstructing H-s at out buoys by using wave parameters from nearby buoys, based on the spatial correlation among values at neighboring buoy locations. The novelty of our approach for its potential application to problems in coastal engineering is twofold. On one hand, we propose a genetic algorithm hybridized with an extreme learning machine that selects, among the available wave parameters from the nearby buoys, a subset F-nsp with n(sp) parameters that minimizes the H-s reconstruction error. On the other hand, we evaluate to what extent the selected parameters in subset are good enough in assisting other machine learning (ML) regressors (extreme learning machines, support vector machines and gaussian process regression) to reconstruct H-s. The results show that all the ML method explored achieve a good H-s reconstruction in the two different locations studied (Caribbean Sea and West Atlantic). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Cricket is one of the most popular sports in Australia, Caribbean, UK and South Asian nations with a net fan base of around 2.5 billion. The game has tremendous spectator support in more than 100 nations and the masses show great interest in predicting the game outcomes. There are lots of pre-game and in-game attributes which decides the outcome of a cricket match. Pre-game attributes like the venue, past track-records, innings(first/second), team strength etc. and the various in-game attributes like toss, run rate, wickets remaining, strike rate etc. influence the result of a match in a predominant manner. In this study, 2 different ML approaches namely Decision Trees and Multilayer Perceptron Network have been used to analyse the effect produced on the outcome of a cricket match due to these varied factors. Based on these results CricAI: Cricket Match Outcome Prediction System has been developed. The designed tool takes into consideration the pre-game attributes like the ground, venue (home, away, neutral) and innings (first/second) for predicting the final result of given match.

However, its current distribution and high-risk areas are little known. We conducted a modelling study to determine the areas with highest prevalence of MAYV occurrence in South America, based on confirmed cases and serological detection over the last 20 years and socio-environmental variables. We performed our analysis using Maxent software, a machine learning algorithm used for species distribution modeling. Our results showed that the occurrence of MAYV is mainly associated with the biome type, population density, annual rainfall, annual vapor rate, and elevation. Among biome types, the one most related to the occurrence of MAYV is Cerrado, probably related to the lifecycle of the Haemagogus vector and human population concentrations. According to our modelling, there is high yet undetectable MAYV concentration in the central region of Brazil and west-coastal region of the continent. A change in virus dispersion patterns was observed. The virus was previously predominantly in forests but now occupied rural areas and was becoming increasingly urbanized, which is increases the risk of outbreaks. Our results will serve to identify priority areas in the development of preventive actions and structuring of epidemiological surveillance.

For representing the trajectory-dynamics properties local-optimal policies are defined to minimize the one-step decrement of the cost-function. We propose a state-value function that increase and decrease between states of the Markov decision processes. Then, we show that a Lyapunov mono-objective function, which can only decrease over time, can be built for the system. For illustration purposes, we present a simulated experiment that shows the trueness of the suggested method.

Its objective is to discern images of skin cancer, specifically melanoma, from others that show only common spots or other types of skin diseases, using image recognition. This work makes use of the ABCDE visual rule, which is often used by dermatologists for melanoma identification, to define which characteristics are analyzed by the software. It then applies various algorithms and techniques, including an ellipse-fitting algorithm, to extract and measure these characteristics and decide whether the spot is a melanoma or not. The achieved results are presented with special focus on the adaptive decision-making and its effect on the diagnosis. Finally, other applications of the software and its algorithms are presented.

Computational Intelligence Methods Applied to the Fraud Detection of Electric Energy Consumers	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Non-technical energy loss; Neural networks; Classification; Machine learning		Brazilian Energy Distributors need to pay special attention to electric energy loss due to non-technical irregularities. Fraud and robbery represents a loss of revenue of billions of dollars every year. The energy utilities first approach to this problem was the creation of campaigns for prevention, raising awareness of the population and encouraging the denunciation of fraudsters. Unfortunately, this was not enough, and proactive actions were needed. The current effective strategy is conducting technical inspections at consumers to whom there is some kind of evidence, based on customer data, consumption patterns, reader's notes, etc. This paper the application of neural network models, nnet and avNNet, on selecting a set of consuming units for which there is a high probability of frauds and irregularities. It also includes data enrichment to enhance the results of such neural networks. First, it presents a brief introduction about the problem, scope of this article and related work. The data, to which the companies usually have access, is analyzed and the classification model construction is described. Then, the resulting models are compared considering the precision, accuracy and duration of training. Finally, there is a reasoning concerning such results and remarks about how energy distributors may use this information.

Tactile Sensing Glove-Based System for Objects Classification Using Support Vector Machine	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Tactile sensors; Classification algorithms; Haptic interfaces; Machine learning algorithms	OF-THE-ART; SENSOR	Peripheral neuropathies affect around 2% to 8% of the adult population and are usually caused by diseases such as diabetes, hanseniasis, and alcoholism. The sensitivity loss resulting from this type of injury makes it much more difficult to the patients cope with daily activities such as writing, driving, and eating. Electronic gloves are capable of reproducing the human sensorial capacities regarding the classification and the differentiation of objects. In this paper, we present an intelligent low-cost glove using pressure sensors to classify objects by using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Two capacitive pressure sensors were manufactured from thin sheets of copper and a layer of Ethyl Vinyl Acetate (EVA). These sensors were attached to the thumb and the index fingers of a glove of polyamide-spandex. The obtained capacitance values, represented in the form of digital levels, were analyzed by a software developed in Matlab, which is responsible for both the serial communication and the interface using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It was possible to observe that the measurements conducted for different objects gather in clusters, which may be distinguished with an error smaller than 2% for an 11-object-training session using an average Gaussian SVM classifier. The results allowed developing an electronic system for objects classification which can help patients with neuropathies and the emerging assistive technologies.	[Ruiz, L. I.

In this paper we review the most recent heart sound processing publications, discussing their adequacy for implementation in digital stethoscopes. Our results show a body of interesting and promising work, although we identify three important limitations of this research field: lack of a set of universally accepted heart-sound features, badly described experimental methodologies and absence of a clinical validation step.

J	Ludena, MGP				Ludena, Maria Gabriela Palacio			Falling through the Cracks: Digital Infrastructures of Social Protection in Ecuador	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article							LATIN-AMERICA; POLICY; POVERTY	While cash transfers gain prominence as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a strong impulse to regard them as a stepping-stone towards the formalization of employment and universalization of social protection. This contribution problematizes how populations in informality are included in narrowly targeted social assistance interventions, which are heavily reliant on targeted schemes and fail to make informality legible to programme administrators. The focus of the article lies in the politics of exclusion and inclusion that permeate digital infrastructures, particularly data infrastructures such as social registries, that are used to target Ecuador's most prominent social assistance programme, Bono de Desarrollo Humano, and the COVID-related programme Bono de Proteccion Familiar. The article is based on ethnographic work, interviews and narrative analysis. It finds that social registries compiled for proxy means testing weaken the link between eligibility and informal employment and obscure the processes that perpetuate precarity. More recent data innovations, such as machine learning, are also insufficient to locate vulnerable workers as they learn from historical social registries data and replicate their biases, for example by overlooking non-poor areas where informal employment also occurs. Data infrastructures have shifted attention to the technicalities of the selection of beneficiaries and away from power imbalances in the design of social assistance, despite their selectivity and politics.

This study describes the application of remote biometric technologies to such investigations on a large scale for the first time. The performance of this research was under real conditions producing results that conform to natural human diurnal and seasonal rhythm patterns. The derived results of this, 208 million data research on diurnal emotions, valence and facial temperature correlate with the results of an analogical Twitter research performed worldwide (UK, Australia, US, Canada, Latin America, North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia). It is established that diurnal valence and sadness were correlated with one another both prior to and during the period of the coronavirus crisis, and that there are statistically significant relationships between the values of diurnal happiness, sadness, valence and facial temperature and the numbers of their data. Results from the simulation and formal comparisons appear in this article. Additionally the analyses on the COVID-19 screening, diagnosing, monitoring and analyzing by applying biometric and AI technologies are described in Housing COVID-19 Video Neuroanalytics.

One of the challenges that has caught the attention in the area of research of prevention of traffic accidents, it is the generation of mechanisms that contribute to monitoring and evaluating the driver behavior. This paper presents a prediction model based on Machine Learning techniques to detect cognitive states based on the monitoring of the electroencephalographic signals of drivers of vehicles acquired in various real driving scenarios. The proposed prediction model consists of three phases: 1. - Acquisition of electroencephalographic signals from drivers in real time. 2. - Select and extract the main characteristics of the signals. 3. - Develop the prediction model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, it was compared with two Machine Learning Techniques: K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression (LR). The results obtained through the experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has the best performance in the evaluation and prediction of the cognitive workload of the physiological signals of the conductors, with a 93% accuracy in the classification of the information compared to other models that have an 84% and 54% accuracy in the classification.

Automatic Detection of Team Roles in Computer Supported Collaborative Work	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Team Roles; Teamwork; Groupware; Computer Supported Collaborative Work		Computer systems designed to support teamwork are environments that enable and enhance collaboration among users. These systems, named groupware, incorporate techniques that facilitate communication and coordination among team members to improve group performance. However, as not all team members are identical, it is important to study users' characteristics to build more productive teams. Team Roles Theory allows obtaining the best possible performance taking into account individual skills, combining the weaknesses of each role with the strengths of other team members. Therefore, it is essential in group formation to consider mind the role each member is capable of playing. Currently, each team member has to complete lengthy questionnaires to determine his team role. We propose an approach for automatic detection of team roles from the observation of user interactions in CSCW systems. Particularly, we apply Artificial Intelligence to obtain the team role that best suits a user's characteristics and behaviours. To achieve this, the performance of various classification algorithms was analyzed. The results show that our approach can detect team roles with high degrees of precision.	[Garcia, P.; Balmaceda, J.

Monitoring of Multivariate Processes Through the Regression Adjustment Procedure Based on Artificial Neural Networks	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						artificial neural network; multivariate statistical control; regression	IMPROVEMENT	In current production systems, organizations must control the total of the variables that have a correlated influence on the final quality of the products. For this task, multivariate statistical control is used. One of the most used multivariate control methods is the so-called regression adjustment whose scheme proposes that to monitor a final quality characteristic in a product, a multiple regression should be applied on the previous variables that define it in the process and the resulting residue will be controlled from a univariate control chart to detect changes in the variations, however, the utility of the procedure is directly related to the efficiency of the method used to perform the adjustment task between the dependent and independent variables. The present work proposed to use an artificial neural network to carry out the adjustment operation, the results showed a remarkable superiority of the proposed scheme in comparison with the current scheme (Least Squares) and adjustment methods proposed in the literature (LAD and M). The proposed multivariate control approach allows the evolution of the regression adjustment method with the incorporation of artificial intelligence.

Classification of Satellite Images by means of Fuzzy Rules generated by a Genetic Algorithm	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Fuzzy thematic classifier; fuzzy rules; genetic algorithm; remotely sensed images	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION	The data acquired by Remote Sensing systems allow obtaining thematic maps of the earth's surface, by means of the registered image classification. This implies the identification and categorization of all pixels into land cover classes. Traditionally, methods based on statistical parameters have been widely used, although they show some disadvantages. Nevertheless, some authors indicate that those methods based on artificial intelligence, may be a good alternative. Thus, fuzzy thematic classifiers, which are based on Fuzzy Logic, include additional information in the classification process through based-rule systems. In this work, we propose the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the optimal and minimum set of fuzzy rules to classify remotely sensed images by means a fuzzy classifier. Input information of GA has been obtained through the training space determined by two uncorrelated spectral bands (2D scatter diagrams), which has been irregularly divided by five linguistic terms defined in each band. The proposed methodology has been applied to Landsat-TM images and it has showed that this set of rules provides a higher accuracy level in the classification results.

Dynamic dispatch algorithm proposal for last-mile delivery vehicle	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Last-mile delivery; scheduling; dynamic decision process	HYBRID GENETIC ALGORITHM	The complex urban scenario demands decisions which needs to be taken not only fast, but considering a high level of uncertainty. In such context, this study proposes an algorithm to address the vehicle allocation scheduling with a request list unknown a priori, and is revealed along the operation horizon. Based on the OSCO (online stochastic combinatorial optimization) problem, it is presented a framework to operate such problem in a last-mile delivery system where customers requests from e-commerce (or food delivery) along an operations day. The deterministic calculation was realized using a permutational flowshop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing makespan. Experiments indicated convergence in the algorithm along the planning trials, and a satisfactory makespan prediction, before the orders are revealed, with accuracy. The probability distribution adheres with a bell-shaped (normal) distribution with its population parameters estimated using classical statistics inference theory. Incorporating uncertain in such type of mathematical modeling could open doors for a new era of systems in current days with cloud computing, big data, smart cities, and artificial intelligence.

Fuzzy Logic Application in Multi-Period Performance Analysis of a SWTP	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Fuzzy logic; Wastewater treatment; IEEE transactions; Wastewater; Power systems; Nitrogen; Matlab; electric power generation; energy system optimization; fuzzy logic; multi-period criterion; small wastewater treatment plant	SYSTEM; ALLOCATION; BIOGAS	A preliminary study on artificial intelligence techniques applied to analyze a small wastewater treatment plant (SWTP), which is installed at FEG-UNESP, using fuzzy logic to take advantage of biogas produced through wastewater treatment for electric power generation, where different wastewater flows during small plant dairy work were considered, is the goal for this work. This study began with sub-systems identification. After that, this information was used to elaborate on the problem formulation, and they were organized as fuzzy rules representation for small WTP, with multi-period characteristics. After all, the system is simulated with MATLABs Fuzzy Logic Toolbox, using the Mamdani algorithm. Only wastewater flow and gasometer output valve were considered for the first simulation. Biogas volume in the gasometer was included in a second one. The first results pointed to efficiency in this technology use, which uses verbal language to represent information from staff and makes it so easy. Based on this, it is possible to conclude that a supervisory and control system for the small wastewater treatment plant (SWTP) is fully feasible.

The problem is challenging because the arrival sequence is not known in advance, which makes it difficult to minimize container rehandling during the ship loading operation. This paper provides a heuristic procedure for the container space allocation problem employing reach stacker vehicles as container handling equipment. Procedures reported in the existing literature apply to rubber-tired gantry (RTG) cranes. Therefore, we are extending current research to the cases of port terminals that employ reach stacker vehicles, commonly used by small or medium size ports in emerging countries such as in Latin America. In addition, we adapted a procedure recently published in the literature. Empirical results show that the proposed heuristic yields better performance than the adapted heuristic. Another contribution of this paper is the formulation of a perfect information mathematical model which computes a lower bound on the number of rehandles required to load a group of containers given their arrival sequence to the port. The gap between the number of rehandle movements achieved by the proposed heuristic and the perfect information model is reported.

WASE-COVID Investigators	Echocardiographic Correlates of In-Hospital Death in Patients with Acute COVID-19 Infection: The World Alliance Societies of Echocardiography (WASE-COVID) Study	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY			English	Article						Echocardiography; WASE; International; COVID-19; Mortality; Strain	RIGHT-VENTRICULAR FAILURE; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; MYOCARDIAL INJURY; TROPONIN; ASSOCIATION; MORTALITY	Background: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 virus, which has led to the global coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is known to adversely affect the cardiovascular system through multiple mechanisms. In this international, multicenter study conducted by the World Alliance Societies of Echocardiography, we aim to determine the clinical and echocardiographic phenotype of acute cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients, to explore phenotypic differences in different geographic regions across the world, and to identify parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. Methods: We studied 870 patients with acute COVID-19 infection from 13 medical centers in four world regions (Asia, Europe, United States, Latin America) who had undergone transthoracic echocardiograms. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, including patient outcomes. Anonymized echocardiograms were analyzed with automated, machine learning-derived algorithms to calculate left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction, and LV longitudinal strain (LS). Right-sided echocardiographic parameters that were measured included right ventricular (RV) LS, RV free-wall strain (FWS), and RV basal diameter. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and echocardiographic parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. Results: Significant regional differences were noted in terms of patient comorbidities, severity of illness, clinical biomarkers, and LV and RV echocardiographic metrics. Overall in-hospital mortality was 21.6%. Parameters associated with mortality in a multivariate analysis were age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12 [1.05, 1.22], P = .003), previous lung disease (OR = 7.32 [1.56, 42.2], P = .015), LVLS (OR = 1.18 [1.05, 1.36], P = .012), lactic dehydrogenase (OR = 6.17 [1.74, 28.7], P = .009), and RVFWS (OR = 1.14 [1.04, 1.26], P = .007). Conclusions: Left ventricular dysfunction is noted in approximately 20% and RV dysfunction in approximately 30% of patients with acute COVID-19 illness and portend a poor prognosis. Age at presentation, previous lung disease, lactic dehydrogenase, LVLS, and RVFWS were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Regional differences in cardiac phenotype highlight the significant differences in patient acuity as well as echo cardiographic utilization in different parts of the world.

Yet, most research is undermined by low interpretability and specificity. Methods Combining statistical and machine learning analyses of natural speech data, we aimed to discriminate ADD patients from healthy controls (HCs) based on automated measures of domains typically affected in ADD: semantic granularity (coarseness of concepts) and ongoing semantic variability (conceptual closeness of successive words). To test for specificity, we replicated the analyses on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Results Relative to controls, ADD (but not PD) patients exhibited significant differences in both measures. Also, these features robustly discriminated between ADD patients and HC, while yielding near-chance classification between PD patients and HCs. Discussion Automated discourse-level semantic analyses can reveal objective, interpretable, and specific markers of ADD, bridging well-established neuropsychological targets with digital assessment tools.

Dorado; Jimenez, Daniel; Gardeazabal, Andrea			Multiyear Maize Management Dataset collected in Chiapas, Mexico	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Explanatory machine learning; Sustainable intensification; Smallholders; Tropical agriculture		For several decades, maize (Zea mays L.) management decisions in smallholder farming in tropical regions have been a puzzle. To best balance alternative management practices' environmental and economic outcomes, an extensive dataset was gathered through CIMMYT's knowledge hub in Chiapas, a state in southern Mexico. In a knowledge hub, farmers, with the support of farm advisors, compare conventional and improved agronomic practices side-by-side and install demonstration fields where they implement improved practices. In all these fields data on on-farm operations and results is collected. The dataset was assembled using field variables (yield, cultivars, fertilization and tillage practice), as well as environment variables from soil mapping (slope, elevation, soil texture, pH and organic matter concentration) and gridded weather datasets (precipitation, temperature, radiation and evapotranspiration). The dataset contains observations from 4585 fields and comprises a period of 7 years between 2012 and 2018. This dataset will facilitate analytical approaches to represent spatial and temporal variability of alternative crop management decisions based on observational data and explain model-generated predictions for maize in Chiapas, Mexico. In addition, this data can serve as an example for similar efforts in Big Data in Agriculture. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Using the Random Forest Algorithm for Searching Behavior Patterns in Electronic Health Records	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Data analysis; Data mining; Health information management; Machine learning algorithms		The search for information associated with qualitative data is usually done using data mining algorithms, the presented research analyzes data of patients with essential hypertension (HTA), patients who have developed hypertension but there is no clear reason why it has occurred. In this research, a search of behavioral patterns was performed in the data associated with the clinical records of 8470 patients using the Random Forest algorithm. As a case study, the proposal focuses on finding the relationship between the different pathologies or factors associated to Hypertensive patients (other diseases for example). The findings validate the right use of the algorithm due to the results obtained agrees with the knowledge defined and validated in the literature. Thus, trivial knowledge can be obtained with the algorithm used. However, non-trivial knowledge was also obtained given the analysis performed on a total of 4408 data of female patients and 4062 of male patients showed a great difference between the factors or pathologies that a patient presents when classified according to their sex, thus another deep study must be carried out closely with experts in the area of the health as future research.

These organizations carry out activities that might be undertaken in a plan driven and agile manner with the support of such tools. A proper balance between both approaches and the effective tool adoption will help organizations to meet their objectives and evolve. Small and medium enterprises and Cooperatives (S&C) share common characteristics throughout Latin America. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) lack of formality in their roles and relationships among interacting individuals, whereas Cooperatives are usually small companies with weaknesses as to management techniques and technological equipment. In fact, both have difficulties when finding the right personnel and tools that best suit their needs. Considering Venezuela as our study subject, we have herein proposed some criteria to assist S&C in the tools selection that support their development processes while fostering the balance required between agility and discipline. Such criteria were formulated based on the characterization of five factors aimed at determining this balance. These contributions will help subsequently identifying methodological and technical aspects to provide guidance to S&C in the improvement of their development processes.

Determination of the seismic signatures of landslides in soft soils: A methodology based on a field scale shear box	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Field shear box; Microseismic monitoring; Landslides		We present a novel field experimental setup that can be used for studying the characteristics of landslide seismicity. The setup consists of a concrete, filled with soil, cylinder that moves along a surficial soil corridor. The emitted seismic signals are due to soil friction. The cylinder acts as an upscaled sheer-box allowing control over a number of parameters: the magnitude of normal stress on the failure plane, the degree of saturation and the type of soil. This allows for the simulation of soil friction within, or between, different geological layers under different conditions. Results are site specific, but can be easily reproduced for any geological environment. We validate this methodology by comparing the spectral characteristics of the signals emitted by the movement of the cylinder to those induced by a controlled failure of a 2.5 m high vertical face at a nearby site with very similar geology. We find a very good agreement between the two. This methodology can be used as a site investigation tool for the optimization of the deployment geometry of seismic networks for landslide monitoring, as well as to inform machine learning algorithms on automatic detection and classification of recorded signals during seismic monitoring of landslides.

Towards a Set of Heuristics for Evaluating Chatbots	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Chatbot; Usability; Silicon compounds; ISO Standards; IEEE transactions; User interfaces; Tools; Chatbots; Evaluation; Heuristics; Usability	USABILITY HEURISTICS	Chatbots are artificial intelligence tools that interact with people in different contexts. A chatbot can be useful to streamline daily processes, serve customers 24 hours a day, provide information about classes, among other things. The appearance of new development technologies has made creating a chatbot an increasingly fast and straightforward process, bringing this kind of applications to people who had never considered using them before. However, this speed in development can lead to specific problems, many of them caused by the lack of usability evaluations. Heuristic usability evaluations are user interface review processes carried out by experts and are an essential part of any assessment process. To date, there are no heuristics to evaluate the usability of chatbots. Therefore, this work proposes five usability heuristics in chatbots that come from the experience developing this type of applications, as well as from a broad review of state of the art. The set of heuristics was tested using a case study with the help of five experts, who evaluated an education-oriented chatbot. The results revealed that, although the proposed heuristics need refinement, they are an excellent first step in broadening the horizon of usability evaluations in chatbots.

An Approximate Power Flow for Distribution Systems	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						power flow; distribution systems; mismatch current equations	NETWORK RECONFIGURATION	Power flow calculation is the most used procedure in electrical power systems. Generally, most of optimization problems in electric power systems need a steady state analysis to evaluate the objective function. Especially, those optimization problems that make use of artificial intelligence techniques, where, due to the high number of iterations, the power flow calculation has a crucial role. In these cases, the method used for solving the power flow must be fast and accurate at the same time. This paper presents an approximate power flow solution method to solve distribution systems. The proposed method is based on current mismatch equations. The system of obtained equations cannot be presented as a set of linear complex equations. So, a simplification is introduced in this paper in order to express the system by a set of linear complex equations instead of a double set of linear real equations. Regarding the topology of the network, the proposed method is valid for both radial and mesh distribution systems. Finally, so as to demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed method, a set of test distribution systems obtained from the technical literature have been used to test it.	[Mena, A.

Mexican Sign Language Alphanumerical Gestures Recognition using 3D Haar-like Features	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Boosting; Gesture recognition; Sign language; Machine learning; 3D Haar-like features		The Mexican Sign Language (LSM) is a language of the deaf Mexican community, which consists of a series of gestural signs articulated by hands and accompanied with facial expressions. The lack of automated systems to translate signs from LSM makes integration of hearing-impaired people to society more difficult. This work presents a new method for LSM alphanumerical signs recognition based on 3D Haar-like features extracted from depth images captured by the Microsoft Kinect sensor. Features are processed with a boosting algorithm. To evaluate performance of our method, we recognized a set of signs from letters and numbers, and compared the results with the use of traditional 2D Haar-like features. Our system is able to recognize static LSM signs with a higher accuracy rate than the one obtained with widely used 2D features.

J	Saavedra, S; Romero, M				Saavedra, Santiago; Romero, Mauricio			Local incentives and national tax evasion: The response of illegal mining to a tax reform in Colombia	EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW			English	Article						Tax evasion; Illegal mining; Satellite images; Colombia	DECENTRALIZATION; MORTALITY; RATES	Achieving a fair distribution of resources is one of the goals of fiscal policy. To this end, governments often transfer tax resources from richer to more marginalized areas. In the context of mining in Colombia, we study whether lower transfers to the locality where the taxed economic activity takes place dampen local authorities' incentives to curb tax evasion. Using machine learning predictions on satellite imagery to identify mines allows us to overcome the challenge of measuring evasion. Employing difference-in-differences strategies, we find that reducing the share of revenue transferred back to mining municipalities leads to an increase in illegal mining. This result highlights the difficulties inherent in adequately redistributing tax revenues.

A Job Stress Predictive Model Evaluation Through Classifier's Algorithms	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						job stress; predictive model; machine learning techniques; pattern recognition; mobile application	RECOGNITION	Nowadays, job stress is very common and it has a high cost in terms of workers' health, absenteeism and lower performance. Although stress is not a disease, it is the first sign of a bigger problem which can generate long-term damages. This paper presents a predictive model of job stress which was obtained from data collected by telephone mobile and sensors. Relevant attributes were identified through a correlation analysis. Learning algorithms were applied in order to determine the predictive model. We use the classifier algorithms ZeroR, Naive Bayes, Simple Logistics, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest-Neighbor, AdaBoost and Random Tree. The proposed model obtained an accuracy of 0.947, a coverage of 0.941 and an F-measure of 0.939. This model was implemented in a mobile application called "TestStress". Also, the results obtained of the experimentation with the app are presented.

However, the effect of land use change on soil properties is often unknown due to poor access to remote areas. Effective management and conservation of soils requires the development spatial approaches that measure and predict dynamic soil properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC). This study estimates the SOC stock in the Eastern Plains of Colombia, with validation and uncertainty analyses, using legacy data of 653 soil samples. A random forest model of nine environmental covariate layers was used to develop predictions of SOC content. Model validation was determined using the Taylor series method, and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and mean error (ME) were calculated to assess model performance. We found that the model explained 50.28% of the variation within digital SOC content map. Raster layers of SOC content, bulk density, and coarse rock fragment within the Eastern Plains were used to calculate SOC stock within the region. With uncertainty, SOC stock in the topsoil of the Eastern Plains was 1.2 G t ha(-1). We found that SOC content contributed nearly all the uncertainty in the SOC stock predictions, although better determinations of SOC stock can be obtained with the use of a more geomorphological diverse dataset. The digital soil maps developed in this study provide predictions of extant SOC content and stock in the topsoil of the Eastern Plains, important soil information that may provide insight into the development of research, regulatory, and legislative initiatives to conserve and manage this evolving ecosystem.

Considering that companies need elements to help them select the best software to support business processes, we propose a list of factors, which companies in Venezuela should consider when making a decision on ERP software. Later, this list is hierarchically ordered and becomes a formal tool for software selection, so that the company does not assess inappropriate or insignificant factors when choosing the application to be purchased. The study was carried out by means of surveys of Venezuelan firms that had already implemented ERP software in order to analyze their experience with this type of software. Once determined, the factors were hierarchically ordered to establish criteria for the software selection. Finally an analysis was conducted of the main selection factors determined in this study.

Prediction of Aggressive Comments in Social Media: an Exploratory Study	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						aggressiveness; social media; prediction; artificial neural networks; support vector machines		This paper presents a set of techniques for predicting aggressive comments in social media. In a time when cyberbullying has, unfortunately, made its entrance into society and Internet, it becomes necessary to find ways for preventing and overcoming this phenomenon. One of these concerns the use of machine learning techniques for automatically detecting cases of cyberbullying; a primary task within this cyberbullying detection consists of aggressive text detection. We concretely explore different computational techniques for carrying out this task, either as a classification or as a regression problem, and our results suggest that a key feature is the identification of profane words.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can rapidly survey newly planted forest areas using high resolution imagery. Automated image processing techniques can cost-effectively examine large quantities of data. Correctly combined, such technologies can efficiently create accurate maps of seedling locations, which offers the prospect of management practices for forestry and ecology operations that involve less fieldwork. This paper presents a technique based on unsupervised machine learning for detecting healthy young pinus caribaea (Caribbean pine) and pinus radiata (Monterey pine) seedlings. The locations of individual trees requiring replacement are also determined based on the spatial distribution of the identified healthy trees. The approach was tested on data from 30 sites covering over 700 ha, with seedlings ranging from 9 months to 3 years' old (mean tree heights 30-2 m). Test sites contained a range of geomorphologies and levels of weed infestation. The results indicate detection precision and specificity in excess of 90% and recall approaching 99% for dense point cloud resolution of 4-6 cm. As network pre-training is unnecessary, there is no need for high resolution imagery, which allows greater operational coverage per unit time. The algorithm may also be used on multi-or hyperspectral data; and may be useful if employed in conjunction with other supervised learning techniques to reduce the need for manual labelling of training data sets.

Coral reef scientists are therefore challenged with the task of providing prompt and relevant inputs for science-based decision-making. Here, we provide a baseline dataset, covering 1300km of tropical coral reef habitats globally, and comprised of over one million geo-referenced, high-resolution photo-quadrats analysed using artificial intelligence to automatically estimate the proportional cover of benthic components. The dataset contains information on five major reef regions, and spans 2012-2018, including surveys before and after the 2016 global bleaching event. The taxonomic resolution attained by image analysis, as well as the spatially explicit nature of the images, allow for multi-scale spatial analyses, temporal assessments (decline and recovery), and serve for supporting image recognition developments. This standardised dataset across broad geographies offers a significant contribution towards a sound baseline for advancing our understanding of coral reef ecology and thereby taking collective and informed actions to mitigate catastrophic losses in coral reefs worldwide.

However, the cumulative effect of small frequent fires can shape large landscapes, and fire-prone ecosystems are abundant in the tropics. Climate change has the potential to greatly expand fire-prone areas to moist and wet tropical forests and grasslands that have been traditionally less fire-prone, and to extend and create more temporal variability in fire seasons. We built a machine learning random forest classifier to analyze the relationship between climatic, socio-economic, and fire history data with fire occurrence and extent for the years 2003-2011 in Puerto Rico, nearly 35,000 fires. Using classifiers based on climate measurements alone, we found that the climate space is a reliable associate, if not a predictor, of fire occurrence and extent in this environment. We found a strong relationship between occurrence and a change from average weather conditions, and between extent and severity of weather conditions. The probability that the random forest classifiers will rank a positive example higher than a negative example is 0.8-0.89 in the classifiers for deciding if a fire occurs, and 0.64-0.69 in the classifiers for deciding if the fire is greater than 5 ha. Future climate projections of extreme seasons indicate increased potential for fire occurrence with larger extents.

Analyzing the Effect of Variables in the Software Development Effort Estimation	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Datamining; Effort estimation; Decision Trees; Regression Trees; Software metrics; Software projects; Variables selection		Due to the variability of variables, the estimation of effort in software development is considered as a very difficult task. Maybe due to small databases, uncertain and very subjective information. For these reason, in this paper, we introduce a study of the effect of variables in the software development effort estimation process. The estimation employing lines of codes, function points and engineering task, were taken as reference. With the use of datamining and machine learning technics, were demonstrated that the effort estimation using engineering task is more accurate. And, by the other hand, was established the influence of each variable, in the software development effort estimation process.

While DRL has shown great results for single task learning, the multi-task case is still underrepresented in the available literature. This D.Sc. research proposal aims at extending DRL to the multi-task case by leveraging the power of Transfer Learning algorithms to improve the training time and results for multi-task learning. Our focus lies on defining a novel framework for scalable DRL agents that detects similarities between tasks and balances various TL techniques, like parameter initialization, policy or skill transfer.

In view of the above difficulties, this paper proposes a small object detection algorithm based on multi-scale feature fusion. By learning shallow features at the shallow level and deep features at the deep level, the proposed multi-scale feature learning scheme focuses on the fusion of concrete features and abstract features. It constructs object detector (MSFYOLO) based on multi-scale deep feature learning network and considers the relationship between a single object and local environment. Combining global information with local information, the feature pyramid is constructed by fusing different depth feature layers in the network. In addition, this paper also proposes a new feature extraction network (CourNet), through the way of feature visualization compared with the mainstream backbone network, the network can better express the small object feature information. The proposed algorithm is valuated on the MS COCO and achieved leading performance with 11.7% improvement in FPS, 17.0% improvement in AP, 81.0% improvement in ARS, and 23.3% reduction in computational FPLOs compared to YOLOv3. This study shows that the combination of global information and local information is helpful to detect the expression of small objects in different illumination. MSFYOLO uses CourNet as the backbone network, which has high efficiency and a good balance between accuracy and speed.

Adaptive-boosting machine learning and cross-validation strategies are implemented to test the overall classification capabilities of these indexes, their consistency and coherence with the biomechanical expectations for these tests. As a result, select indexes of performance are highlighted, and the relevance of these features and parameters to performance in these parts of the DGI assessment, as consistent, quantitative measures of performance, supplementary to evaluations by specialized physicians, is tested.

Bio-Inspired Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Navigation of Artificial Agents	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Reinforcement Learning; Autonomous Navigation; Visual Models		Autonomous navigation of artificial agents is a challenging task for changing and complex environments. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are widely used for autonomous navigation, where the agent, through the interaction with the environment, learns the behaviors needed to maximize the reward. Recent architectures extract information from the environment using convolutional neural networks, where the visual features needed to maximize the reward are unknown and uncertain, and then, increasing the number of parameters learned by the entire system. Moreover, the presence of sparse rewards complicates, even more, the task generating unstable results in the learning problem. The work here presented is twofold. First, we show the advantages of using retina physiology knowledge to design a visual sensor feeding the RL network. Secondly, based on intrinsic motivation, we propose the use of auxiliary tasks to deal with sparse rewards, generating a continuous learning process. We define two auxiliary tasks, state, and action predictions, forcing the network to learn characteristics of environment; and also, to detect which of them are valuable for the task. These two contributions were implemented in the DeepMind Lab environment simulating an agent moving inside two different maze scenarios. The results obtained reveal a promising extension of the inclusion of biological-plausible mechanisms inside artificial intelligence applications. Moreover, to include auxiliary tasks improves the performance adding robustness to the system.

Deep Learning Transfer with AlexNet for chest X-ray COVID-19 recognition	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						COVID-19; X-ray imaging; Biomedical imaging; Deep learning; Image resolution; Coronaviruses; Visualization; alexnet; x-ray chest; convol; COVID-19; Deep Learning; recognition	CLASSIFICATION	The COVID-19 is a new disease from the virus SARS-CoV-2, the infection can cause respiratory illness with symptoms such as cough, fever, and, in severe cases, pneumonia. Early diagnosis is crucial for the correct treatment to reduce as much as possible the stress in the healthcare system. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease. In this study, we have applied learning transfer to a convolutional neural network known as AlexNet for binary chest X-ray recognition (COVID-19 vs Healthy). We have fine-tunned AlexNet for our specific problem. The first layer, which works with RGB images, is replaced for images in a single intensity (grayscale). 11,312 chest X-ray images from six public databases were used to train the network. Among them are samples of healthy people and samples that present the effect of pneumonia and COVID-19 diseases. The results prove that deep learning with chest X-ray images can extract significant biomarkers related to COVID-19, since the obtained accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 96.5%, 98.0%, and 91.7%, respectively. ROC analysis and confusion matrices are used to validate the results of the fine-tunned AlexNet network	[Cortes, E.] Univ Istmo, Ingn Comp, Campus Tehuantepec, Oax 70760, Mexico; [Sanchez, S.] Univ Istmo, Matemat Aplicadas, Campus Tehuantepec, Oax 70760, Mexico		Cortes, E (corresponding author), Univ Istmo, Ingn Comp, Campus Tehuantepec, Oax 70760, Mexico.	cope144@gmail.com; ssanys1@hotmail.com		SANCHEZ-SANCHEZ, SERGIO/0000-0002-9709-145X; Cortes, Ernesto/0000-0003-2234-7673					67	5	5	8	15	IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC	PISCATAWAY	445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA	1548-0992			IEEE LAT AM T	IEEE Latin Am.

A Data Governance Framework for Industry 4.0	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Data governance; Monitoring; Real-time systems; Industrial Internet of Things; IEEE transactions; Data models; Big Data; Data governance; Data-Centric architecture; Industry 4; 0; Big Data; Real Time		The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, represents a new stage of evolution in the organization, management and control of the value chain throughout the product or service life cycle. This digitization of the industrial environment is characterized by the connection of Information Technologies (IT) and Operations Technologies (OT) through cyber-physical systems and the Industrial IoT (IIoT). One of the main consequences of this integration is the increasing amount and variety of data generated in real time from different sources. In this environment of intensive generation of actionable information, data becomes a critical asset for Industry 4.0, at all stages of the value chain. However, in order to data become a competitive advantage for the company, it must be managed and governed like any other strategic asset, and therefore it is necessary to rely on a Data Governance system. Industry 4.0 requires a reformulation of governance since the data is a key element and the backbone of the processes of the organization. This paper proposes a Reference Framework for the implementation of Data Governance Systems for Industry 4.0. Previously, it contextualizes data governance for Industry 4.0 environments and identifies the requirements that this framework must address, which are conditioned by the specific features of Industry 4.0, among others, the intensive use of big data, cloud and edge computing, artificial intelligence and current regulations.

Along with proven benefits, several collateral drawbacks have risen, one being the widespread of false information with malicious intents, oftentimes using anonymous or false identities. Fighting this problem is challenging, especially when considering the nature of text messages involved on social media platforms: a sea of small messages and a myriad of users. Attributing the authorship of such messages is an ambitious endeavor; nevertheless, it is a way to fight this undesired disinformation scenario. In this work, we tackle the problem of authorship attribution of tiny messages, but, different from what has been done with longer texts, we rely upon data-driven approaches, avoiding handcraft features and harnessing recent advances of deep neural networks in the field of pattern recognition. By modeling small texts employed in social media as unidimensional signals, we propose a deep learning model to project these messages onto a manifold suitable for the task of authorship attribution. We provide two state-of-the-art solutions tailored for different setups and strategies for the scenario of authorship verification. These advances were possible, thanks to three additional contributions: an updated dataset based on the Twitter (R) platform, new sanitization techniques to improve the quality of the training data, and novel visual analytics techniques to help the development of authorship attribution solutions.

All the aforementioned learning strategies, which currently comprises the classification module of the SINPATCO platform, are evaluated according to their ability in discriminating patients as belonging to one out of three categories: Normal, Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis. Confusion matrices of all learning algorithms are also reported, as well as a study of the effect of diversity in the design of the ensembles. The obtained results clearly indicate that the ensembles of classifiers have better generalization performance than standalone classifiers.	[Rocha Neto, A.

In order to mitigate these problems, this work proposes and evaluates a predictive resource allocation approach, implemented as a Configuration Recommender, based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). This combination is used to estimate application runtime and recommends a viable and valid configuration of resources in the cloud, regarding execution time and monetary costs. As a case study, machine learning applications based on the Weka tool are chosen. The results show that predicted times were very close to actual ones, achieving an efficient estimation of time and cost and their consequent reduction.

Studies on haplotype maps are key in understanding how natural selection has produced genomic differences between subspecies of a given species. Important insight can be obtained by determining which variations in the genotype are associated with important phenotypical differences between individuals. Pattern recognition theory and machine learning techniques are useful tools to reveal this connection from a large amount of data provided by haplotype maps. In this work, we applied discrete classifiers and feature selection techniques for the prediction of cattle coat color from genotypes. We compared the performance of different classification rules and showed the feasibility of this approach for the prediction of phenotype based on genotype.	[Benalcazar, M. E.; Pagnuco, I.

It is also proposed an alternative model, illustrating its application through a case of the medical field. The proposed model manages to get a balanced distribution of instances per class. It is based on the automatic selection of a subset of cases from the majority classes, using the natural groupings of these classes through self-organizing maps.

However, the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is having an impact on the principles of learning from primary to tertiary levels. The purpose of this paper is to consider how the 4IR has and will continue to impact education at the various levels of learning. Design/methodology/approach The paper aims to bridge the perceived information gap and provide insights into the kinds of educational preparation and the skills and qualifications that 4IR jobs require. In response, the following are considered: the need to tweak the curriculum, adopt the right technology for in class and online delivery and the projection of other learning techniques and skills that are often not considered pertinent. Data gathering for the report was by discussion with experts and consultation of relevant articles and write-ups from related websites. Findings The advent of smart communication systems involving artificial intelligence, internet, robotics, virtual reality and digital textbooks has opened a new vista in relation to how and what is learnt in schools. Just as technologies brought about smart communication systems, the 4IR model of higher education is rapidly evolving and as such, curriculum development and review must be dynamic, and it must keep pace with the technological advances and skills required in the twenty first century. Originality/value The 4IR era will bring great changes to how students are taught and what students must learn as the tools for transformational learning are already overwhelming. Jobs will be scarce for those without the requisite skills, whereas those with the right skills will have to keep up with the pace of technological development, otherwise they too will be left behind. Schools will increasingly become centres for the generation of innovation and its incubation and in all this, quality learning, teaching and knowledge impartation can easily be carried out online.

In this work, a design of a hierarchical prediction model based on True Path Rule for plants is presented. The training stage is done with Arabidopsis thaliana data characterized with sequence domains and physicochemical properties feeding an ensemble of binary classifiers, one classifier for each functional class. The proposed model is validated against a set of well-known control sequences and with a set of sequences of S. lycopersicum without any annotation by biological experts. The discussed results are promising; the proposal can be enriched with more organisms and with diverse sources of sequence characterizations.

One aspect could be related with the following questions: could neural uncertainty be beneficial from an evolutionary robotics perspective? Is uncertainty a possible mechanism for obtaining more robust artificial systems? Using the minimal cognition approach, we show that moderate levels of uncertainty in the dynamics of continuous-time recurrent networks correlates positively with behavioral robustness of the system. This correlation is possible through internal neural changes depending on the uncertainty level. We also find that controllers evolved with moderate neural uncertainty remain robust to disruptions even when uncertainty is removed during tests, suggesting that uncertainty helps evolution find regions of higher robustness in parameter space.

Fuzzy Classifier for the Diagnosis of Pathology on the Vertebral Column	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						fuzzy classifier; diagnosis; vertebral column; disk hernia; spondylolisthesis	MODELS	This paper describes the training and application of a fuzzy singleton classifier that is used for the diagnosis of pathologies of the vertebral column, discriminating patients as belonging to one out of three categories: Normal, Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis. Each input variable is partitioned into triangular membership functions so that consecutive fuzzy sets exhibit and specific overlapping of 0.5. Singleton consequents are employed and least square method is used to adjust the consequents. Applications are conducted on the vertebral column data set from University of California Irvine UCI Machine Learning Repository. Features of the dataset are obtained from sagittal panoramic radiographies of the spine. The dataset includes 310 instances (310 patients) having 6 real valued attributes in 3 classes.

Currently, there is an increasing interest in predicting the behavior of active work items in any business process, which would make possible to monitor the behavior of such processes in a more accurate way. Given the complexity of current business processes, conventional techniques are not always effective in addressing this type of requirements; therefore, machine learning techniques are being increasingly more used for this task. This work deals with the problem of fail detection in a BPM system from event logs, based on machine learning methods. The paper explores the use of two structural learning models, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM). Both models are suitable to model sequence data, but the last one can take into consideration the duration time that the underlying process remains in one state. The experiments are carried out using a real database of about 460,000 event logs sequences. The results show that for the given dataset, fail detection can be achieved with an accuracy of 86.70% using the HSMM model. In order to reduce the computational load of the proposed approach, the models were implemented in a distributed processing environment using Apache Spark, which guarantees the scalability of the solution.

The study of civil unrest is a key topic for political scientists as it helps capture an important mechanism by which citizens express themselves. In countries where civil unrest is lawful, qualitative analysis has revealed that more than 75 percent of the protests are planned, organized, or announced in advance; therefore detecting references to future planned events in relevant news and social media is a direct way to develop a protest forecasting system. We report on a system for doing that in this article. It uses a combination of key-phrase learning to identify what to look for, probabilistic soft logic to reason about location occurrences in extracted results, and time normalization to resolve future time mentions. We illustrate the application of our system to 10 countries in Latin America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Results demonstrate our successes in capturing significant societal unrest in these countries with an average lead time of 4.08 days. We also study the selective superiorities of news media versus social media (Twitter, Facebook) to, identify relevant trade-offs.

In this context, this paper proposes a new feature extraction method based on human tissue density patterns, namely Analysis of Human Tissue Densities in Lung Diseases. The proposed method uses human tissues radiological densities, in Hounsfield Units, to perform the features extraction on thorax computerized tomography images. We compared the proposed method against the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix and Statistical Moments to accomplish the performance evaluation alongside four machine learning classifiers. Overall, the results revealed that the proposal achieved higher accuracy ratios while it took the lowest runtime in all performed experiments. Thus, we consider our proposal as a valid alternative to be used in real-time applications.	[Alves, S. S. A.; Reboucas, E. S.; Oliveira, S. A. F.; Braga, Alan M.; Reboucas Filho, P.

Thus we verify if they can be used in wearable systems and adapted to existing devices of the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling the proposition of efficient and accessible assistive product recognition systems.

In this paper, we address this issue by using adaptive devices that can be incrementally trained, allowing them to aggregate new pieces of information while processing new input entries.

In two hospital-based studies, Puerto Rican Hispanics had a lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation of 2.5% than non-Hispanic Whites with 5.7%. This data is particularly controversial because Hispanics possess a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors for developing AF yet have a lower AF prevalence. This phenomenon is known as the atrial fibrillation paradox. Despite recent advancements in understanding AF, its pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we compared a genetic dataset of Puerto Rican Hispanics to 111 SNP known to be associated with AF in a large European cohort and determine if they are associated with AF susceptibility in our cohort. To achieve this aim, we performed a secondary analysis of existing data using the following two studies: (1) The Pharmacogenetics of Warfarin in Puerto Ricans study and the (2) A Genomic Approach for Clopidogrel in Caribbean Hispanics, and assess for the presence of European SNPs associated with AF from the genome-wide association study of 1 million people identifies 111 loci for atrial fibrillation. We used data from 555 cardiovascular Puerto Rican Hispanic patients, consisting of 486 control and 69 cases. We found that the following SNPs showed significant association with AF in PHR: rs2834618, rs6462079, rs7508, rs2040862, and rs10458660. Some of these SNPs are proteins involved in lysosomal activities responsible for breaking ceramides to sphingosines and collagen deposition around atrial cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we performed a machine learning analysis and determined that Native American admixture and heart failure were strongly predictive of AF in PHR. For the first time, this study provides some genetic insight into AF's mechanisms in a Puerto Rican Hispanic cohort.

J	Zhao, ZJ; Zhang, XH				Zhao, Zijie; Zhang, Xihan			Evaluation of methods to detect and quantify the bimodal precipitation over Central America and Mexico	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						bimodal precipitation; intraseasonal variability; midsummer drought	MIDSUMMER DROUGHT; MJO INFLUENCE; VARIABILITY; TEMPERATURE; RAINFALL	Bimodal precipitation is a globally observed and regionally significant event that has a significant influence on the agriculture, public health, and insurance needs of associated regions. Many studies have focused on the mechanisms behind the generation and development of this event; however, little research into its characteristics exists due to a lack of a widely accepted method for accurate detection and quantification. Using a function collection containing various methods, different methods can be compared in terms of their performance in the detection and quantification of bimodal precipitation signals, allowing the proposal of appropriate criteria for method choice in various study types. Five methods (Mosino and Garcia, 1966; Curtis, 2002; Angeles et al., 2010; Karnauskas et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2020) are adapted to the Climate Prediction Centre data during 1979-2017 in the domain of southern Mexico and Central America, and their performances are evaluated and compared. While outputs from the five methods reach general consistence for strong bimodal features over the Pacific side of Central America and Yucatan Peninsula, some biases are identified, specifically shown by the fact that methods using monthly climatological data demonstrates bimodal precipitation over the Caribbean side of Central America, while those using daily annual data indicate the existence of bimodal precipitation over the Pacific side of southern Mexico. By comparing two typical algorithms, we determined that this bias was induced by the limitation of temporal resolution in monthly climatological data and the nature of algorithms applying daily annual data. As part of a case study, a cluster algorithm was applied to outputs from an algorithm using daily annual precipitation, and a classification algorithm was used to test clustering performance. The resultant general high accuracy shows that annual bimodal signals offer good adaption to cluster and other potential machine learning algorithms.

Yet, the routine use of this treatment remains controversial. To overcome the limitations of previous meta-analyses inherent to the use of aggregate data, we will perform an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) on the effect of hydrocortisone with or without fludrocortisone compared with placebo or usual care on 90-day mortality and other outcomes in patients with septic shock. Methods and analysis To assess the benefits and risks of hydrocortisone, with or without fludrocortisone for adults with septic shock, we will search major electronic databases from inception to September 2020 (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), complimented by a search for unpublished trials. The primary analysis will compare hydrocortisone with or without fludrocortisone to placebo or no treatment in adult patients with septic shock. Secondary analyses will compare hydrocortisone to placebo (or usual care), hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone to placebo (or usual care), and hydrocortisone versus hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone. The primary outcome will be all cause mortality at 90 days. We will conduct both one-stage IPDMA using mixed-effect models and machine learning with targeted maximum likelihood analyses. We will assess the risk of bias related to unshared data and related to the quality of individual trial.

Multi-Scale Approach for Predicting Fish Species Distributions across Coral Reef Seascapes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							REGION-WIDE DECLINES; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; MARINE; COMMUNITIES; RICHNESS; MANAGEMENT; AREAS; ASSEMBLAGES; DIVERSITY	Two of the major limitations to effective management of coral reef ecosystems are a lack of information on the spatial distribution of marine species and a paucity of data on the interacting environmental variables that drive distributional patterns. Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = > 0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92% map accuracy) than BRT (68% map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management.

A Deep Learning Approach to Vegetation Images Recognition in Buildings: a Hyperparameter Tuning Case Study	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						RNA; Vegetation mapping; Deep learning; Image recognition; Tuning; Generators; Biological system modeling; Deep Learning; Convolutional Neural Networks; Vegetation images recognition; hyperparameter tuning	CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS	Deep Learning methods have important applications in digital image processing. However, the literature lacks further studies that propose machine learning models to images classification in civil construction area. For example, the vegetation recognition on facades can be relevant in identifying the degradation and abandonment of buildings. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose an Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) approach to vegetation images recognition in buildings. For this, a database with urban images (low altitude) captured by a drone in Zurich (Switzerland) was adopted. In addition, a rigorous hyperparameters tuning methodology for the CNN model is presented. After adjusting the hyperparameters and the final model, the system achieved 90% of accuracy in the test stage. It should also be noted that CNN correctly classified 97.8% of the positive class (with vegetation on the facade) in test images.	[Ottoni, Andre L.

J	Johnson, WL				Johnson, W. Lewis			Data-Driven Development and Evaluation of Enskill English	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION			English	Article						Development methodologies for AIED systems; Iterative design; Experimental studies; Educational design research; Computer-aided language learning; Dialogue systems	INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM	Cloud computing offers developers of learning environments access to unprecedented amounts of learner data. This makes possible data-driven development (D-3) of learning environments. In the D-3 approach the learning environment is a data collection tool as well a learning tool. It continually collects data from interactions with learners, which is used in ongoing evaluation and iterative development. Iterative development cycles become very rapid, limited by the time required to analyze data and deploy system updates. D-3 is particularly relevant to fielded AIED systems that operate in uncontrolled conditions, where learners may behave in unexpected ways. This article presents two snapshot case studies in the data-driven development of Enskill((R)) English, a system for learning to speak English as a foreign language. In the first trial at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia two versions of Enskill English's dialogue system were tested simultaneously: the released version and a new version incorporating statistical natural language processing technology. A new version was released and data were collected from a second snapshot evaluation at the University of Split, Croatia. Data from learners in Latin America and Europe were analyzed for comparison. The evaluations provided preliminary evidence that Enskill English is helpful for learning spoken English skills, and leading indicators that learner performance improves through practice with Enskill English. They suggest that Enskill English can be extended to meet the needs of more advanced learners who wish to use English in a professional context. Broader recommendations for data-driven development of intelligent learning environments are presented.	[Johnson, W.

The analysis focuses on maize cultivation in Malawi and Ethiopia, and leverages rich, georeferenced plot-level data from national household surveys that were conducted in 2018-20 and integrated with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and complementary geospatial data. To identify the approach to survey data collection that yields optimal data for training remote sensing models, 26,250 in silico experiments are simulated within a machine learning framework. The best model is then applied to map seasonal maize cultivation from 2016 to 2019 at 10-m resolution in both countries. The analysis reveals that smallholder plots with maize cultivation can be identified with up to 75% accuracy. Collecting full plot boundaries or complete plot corner points provides the best quality of information for model training. Classification performance peaks with slightly less than 60% of the training data. Seemingly little erosion in accuracy under less preferable approaches to georeferencing plots results in the total area under maize cultivation being overestimated by 0.16-0.47 million hectares (8-24%) in Malawi.

This is how Blockchain-based techniques are being applied to many fields, focusing in this article on the public sector, as a possible solution to the demands for transparency, participation and citizen cooperation that society demands; due to the possibility of disintermediation based on automated transactions and on the responsibility and security in the management of official blockchain records. This could obstruct corruption and make government services more transparent and efficient. Although, it investigates about applications in the public sector under the Blockchain system, such as transactions, agreements, property registries and innovations, developments and other assets; Special emphasis is placed on the possibility of implementing Smart Contracts (mechanisms that aim to eliminate intermediaries to simplify processes) in public procurement procedures, given that it is in this type of activity where high levels of corruption are generated. It is concluded then that Europe has the largest number of blockchain initiatives worldwide, while Latin America, except for the case of Peru, lacks this type of applications, being this continent exactly where there are the countries with the highest levels of corruption. It concludes with a recommendation to use blockchain along with smart contracts through platforms such as Ethereum or Lisk, mainly given its flexibility and current development on topics with similar functionalities.

Hierarchical Classification with Jumping Emerging Patterns	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Hierarchical Classification; Jumping Emerging Patterns; Data Mining		Classification is a common task in Machine Learning and Data Mining. Some classification problems are called hierarchical classification problems because they need to take into account a hierarchical taxonomy which establishes an order between involved classes. The protein's function prediction is considered a hierarchical classification problem because their functions are arranged in a hierarchical taxonomy of classes. This paper presents an algorithm for hierarchical classification using the jumping emerging patterns approach. Jumping emerging patterns have been used to flat classification and in this work we explore its adoption in a hierarchical classification scenario. The proposed algorithm was evaluated in eight real datasets, compared against two other recent hierarchical classification algorithms from the literature and also with flat k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm. Preliminary results showed that the proposed approach is an alternative for hierarchical classification, having as main advantages the simplicity and understandability with good accuracy.

J	Costa, A; Paraboni, I				Costa, A.; Paraboni, I			Generating Customizable Natural Language Descriptions	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Natural Language Processing; Text Generation; Definite descriptions	REFERRING EXPRESSIONS	In the Natural Language Generation field, the task of Reference Expression Generation (REG) consists of selecting the semantic content that should compose the linguistic description of a discourse object, as in `the man in black' or `the boy in the centre'. REG algorithms tend to use predefined parameters to model qualitative and quantitative aspects of the description to be generated, and are often difficult to adapt to new domains or applications. In addition, obtaining linguistic examples in all possible reference situations is also often impracticable, which limits the use of machine learning approaches in this task. Based on these observations, this work proposes an extension of a standard REG algorithm, in which certain aspects of a reference strategy are customized without necessarily resorting to training data. The proposal was tested by making use of three REG domains, and its results compared favourably against a standard REG approach.

From discourse to pathology: Automatic identification of Parkinson's disease patients via morphological measures across three languages	CORTEX			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Linguistic assessments; Morphology; Automated speech analysis; Cross-linguistic validity	ACTION VERBS; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN MECHANISMS; BASAL GANGLIA; SELECTION; DEFICITS; SPEECH; NOUNS; PERSPECTIVE; PROGRESSION	Embodied cognition research on Parkinson's disease (PD) points to disruptions of frontostriatal language functions as sensitive targets for clinical assessment. However, no existing approach has been tested for crosslinguistic validity, let alone by combining naturalistic tasks with machine-learning tools. To address these issues, we conducted the first classifier-based examination of morphological processing (a core frontostriatal function) in spontaneous monologues from PD patients across three typologically different languages. The study comprised 330 participants, encompassing speakers of Spanish (61 patients, 57 matched controls), German (88 patients, 88 matched controls), and Czech (20 patients, 16 matched controls). All subjects described the activities they perform during a regular day, and their monologues were automatically coded via morphological tagging, a computerized method that labels each word with a part-of-speech tag (e.g., noun, verb) and specific morphological tags (e.g., person, gender, number, tense). The ensuing data were subjected to machine-learning analyses to assess whether differential morphological patterns could classify between patients and controls and reflect the former's degree of motor impairment. Results showed robust classification rates, with over 80% of patients being discriminated from controls in each language separately. Moreover, the most discriminative morphological features were associated with the patients' motor compromise (as indicated by Pearson r correlations between predicted and collected motor impairment scores that ranged from moderate to moderate-to-strong across languages). Taken together, our results suggest that morphological patterning, an embodied frontostriatal domain, may be distinctively affected in PD across languages and even under ecological testing conditions.

Learning Running-time Prediction Models for Gene-Expression Analysis Workflows	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Performance Prediction; Ensemble Learning; Workflows; Bioinformatics; Distributed Computing	CLASSIFICATION	One of the central issues for the efficient management of Scientific workflow applications is the prediction of tasks performance. This paper proposes a novel approach for constructing performance models for tasks in data-intensive scientific workflows in an autonomous way. Ensemble Machine Learning techniques are used to produce robust combined models with high predictive accuracy. Information derived from workflow systems and the characteristics and provenance of the data are exploited to guarantee the accuracy of the models. A gene-expression analysis workflow application was used as case study over homogeneous and heterogeneous computing environments. Experimental results evidence noticeable improvements while using ensemble models in comparison with single/standalone prediction models. Ensemble learning techniques made it possible to reduce the prediction error with respect to the strategies of a single-model with values ranging from 14.47% to 28.36% for the homogeneous case, and from 8.34% to 17.18% for the heterogeneous case.

In this paper, we present a heuristic architecture model for on-board video surveillance system based on Internet of Video Things (IoVT) devices which addresses the need for delivering smart video surveillance in public transport vehicles (e.g., buses) minimizing the impact on network performance. A proof-of-concept was implemented using a public Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and two Raspberry Pi as edge computing nodes. On the edge nodes, a Machine Learning (ML) application was deployed along with a network-efficient video streaming system. On the other hand, laboratory tests are included to understand the network traffic dynamic, furthermore results are enhanced with a set of simulations in order to analyze the performance of a video streaming application and 6 different congestion control algorithms in terms of packet loss and delay.

In this article, we will use all the attributes of the data-set NSL-KDD to train and test a Support Vector Machine model. This model will then be applied to a method of feature selection to obtain the most relevant attributes within the aforementioned data-set and train the model again.

Recognition of Handwritten Digits Using the Signature Features and Optimum-Path Forest	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Machine learning techniques; Pattern Recognition; Digital Image Processing; Computer Vision; OCR Applications; Optimum-Path Forest; OPF		There is a growing need for recognition of digits manuscripts for use in various situations, such as recognition of handwritten postal address digits for automated redirection of letters in the mail, acknowledgment of nominal values in bank checks. Recognition of handwritten digits faces great difficulty in dealing with intra-class variation due to different writing styles, different degrees of inclination of the characters. Optical character recognition systems, also known as OCR, identifying and recognizing printed characters through images, an already widespread functionality in scanners, mobile devices, among others. This paper presents the use of the classifier Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) applied in handwriting recognition digits. A new feature extraction method is proposed using signature of the characters, and the OPF algorithm is used in the classification. According to the results presented, it appears that the detection and recognition of characters are being carried out satisfactorily in the Manhattan distance stood out with an average accuracy of 99.53%, and get training times and test lower than the other methods such as It is the characteristic of OPF method.

Predicting Civilian Preferences in Conflict Negotiations	JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA			English	Article						Colombia; wartime public opinion; conflict termination; civilian attitudes; civil wars		Efforts to end civil wars via negotiations often generate sharp divisions in public opinion. A large, quantitative literature has found evidence for numerous variables serving as potential drivers of public support of and opposition to conflict negotiations. Yet the formation of policy preferences is a complex process, and while many factors might make small contributions to an individual's conflict termination preferences, we lack a sense of which factors matter most or how to adjudicate among competing explanations. In this article, we leverage a large amount of nationally representative survey data from Colombia (2004-2015) and use machine learning tools to systematically explore which variables are the strongest predictors of public support for negotiations with Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC). We find that certain aspects of conflict exposure, individual values bearing on justice and punishment, and belief in the efficacy of the state are among the strongest predictors of negotiation preferences, while many conventionally important variables in the literature have little predictive power. The results have implications for scholars seeking to understand broad drivers of (dis)satisfaction with negotiations and shed light on the polarising Colombian peace process.

Sentiment Analysis Applied to News from the Brazilian Stock Market	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Stock markets; Dictionaries; Sentiment analysis; RNA; Naive Bayes methods; Multilayer perceptrons; IEEE transactions; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining; Stock Market		Investments in the stock market have grown in Brazil in recent years, especially considering the individual number of investors. According to data from April 2020, the Brazilian stock market reached the historic mark of 2.38 million active investors, and with this scenario, there is an increasing need to study the Brazilian financial market, seeking to better understand its fluctuations. Recent work in the literature indicates that a companys stock values can be influenced by published news. Therefore, this work contributes to the automatic sentiment analysis applied to news written in Portuguese and related to the Brazilian stock market. For this, we performed three sentiment analysis strategies: two based on machine learning, using the Naive Bayes classifier and a Multilayer Perceptron neural network; and the other based on the lexical approach. Also, we proposed two dictionaries, focused on the financial domain and adapted to Portuguese. Our results show that the Naive Bayes classifier and the Multilayer Perceptron overcomes the best lexical approach. It is worth mentioning that the accuracy achieved by the best lexical approach was with the adapted dictionary proposed here.

The most relevant areas related to childhood development are the numbers, vision, emotional control, peer social skills, hearing, habitual ways of responding, symbols, and language. For this important reason, in this paper, we present an educational environment aimed at providing a set of tools to contribute to early stimulation of children assisting to low and middle-income schools. Our system relies on mobile apps and stuffed toy robots able to interact with children and other robots to teach several concepts related to early development in both, individual intervention sessions, and group sessions. This tool incorporates a rule-based reasoning expert system to select intervention strategies better. To validate our proposal, we worked with 47 children and a team of experts in the early education area.

These kinds of works have been included in the active Big Code and Mining Software Repositories research fields. Although different machine learning works already classify the syntactic constructs used by programmers, there are no reports about the most common syntactic patterns used by Java programmers. In this article, we describe a system we build to provide such a report. Our system retrieves the syntactic patterns used by Java programmers, distinguishing those utilized by experts and beginners. We also present the anomalies found in the usage of different syntactic constructs. We modify the OpenJDK compiler to double the syntactic information included in its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), define a mechanism to translate ASTs into n-dimensional vectors, combine the information of different syntax constructs to build heterogeneous patterns, and apply the Frequent Pattern Growth algorithm to mine the syntactic patterns as association rules. The mined patterns allow expressing hierarchical subpatterns connected to one another, providing a high level of expressiveness.

In this research, we propose a novel force profile characterizer based on a Machine Learning algorithm (ML), the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Here, we combine the ELM with a Partial Average Test filter (PAT) to predict the behavior of thermostatic bimetallic strips. The computational efficiency inherent to ELMs allows the use of the algorithm (PAT-ELM) in real manufacturing environments, where computational resources tend to be limited and response time is of the utmost importance. The algorithm results were compared with actual measurements taken from production samples following ASTM B106-08, and the force-displacement profile of the thermostatic bimetallic strips measurements. The results show a correlation in excess of 86% including batches smaller than 50 samples. This result was constant even in cases where measurements were affected by noise present in industrial environments. The time required to obtain the strength profile was significantly lower than alternative methods, making this algorithm suitable for IoT systems.

SVM and ANN Application to Multivariate Pattern Recognition Using Scatter Data	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Multivariate patterns; SVM; Fuzzy ARTMAP; PCA; univariate patterns	OF-CONTROL SIGNALS; STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL; NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLE; MANUFACTURING PROCESSES; MODEL	several methods of Statistical Process Control (SPC) are used to analyze process measurements with the purpose to detect faults that affect the process stability. SPC has a major drawback because it indicates the presence of faults without explaining which ones and where are the faults. In practical applications, SPC just analyses univariate signals limiting the study of multiple measures. Nowadays, novel methods have been developed for fault analysis based on pattern recognition in control charts. However, the majority of these studies follow a univariate approach. This article proposes a multivariate pattern recognition approach using machine learning algorithms in conjunction with a scatter diagram as the proposed method. In particular the aim of this approach is to monitor quality characteristics of a product in a multivariate environment considering states in control and out of control without the constraints of statistical conditions with the possibility of its application in real time. Results using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the FuzzyARTMAP neural network showed that multivariate patterns can be recognized successfully in 81% of the cases.

Pruning Extreme Learning Machines Using the Successive Projections Algorithm	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Feedfoward Networks; Extreme Learning Machine; Successive Projections Algorithm	CLASSIFICATION	Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a recently proposed machine learning method with successful applications in many domains. The key strengths of ELM are its simple formulation and the reduced number of hyper-parameters. Among these hyper-parameters, the number of hidden nodes has significant impact on ELM performance since too few/many hidden nodes may lead to underfitting/overfitting. In this work, we propose a pruning strategy for ELM using the Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) as an approach to automatically find the number of hidden nodes. The SPA was originally proposed for variable selection. In this work, it is adapted in order to prune ELMs. The proposed method is compared to the Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine algorithm (OP-ELM), which is considered as a state of the art method. Real world datasets were used to assess the performance of the proposed method for regression and classification problems. The application of the proposed model resulted in much simpler models with similar performance compared to the OP-ELM. For some classification instances, the performance of the proposed method outperformed the OP-ELM method.	[Mesquita, D. P. P.] Univ Fed Ceara UFC, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Gomes, J. P.

Astronomy is one of these areas where relevant methods have been developed to deal mainly with identifying and classification. This work introduces a new approach to characterize and classify sunspots which appear in the solar photosphere for expressing intense magnetic fields. Theses magnetic fields present significant effects on Earth. Solar images were captured in the Intensitygram Flat format, found in the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), which facilitate processing for identification and sunspots count. This method consists of two steps: image pre-processing and training phase using convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify and characterize spots and groups. Results showed a high potential of this processing that become a competitive classifier for the sunspots groups.

In this paper, drawing on the structural power of business, we examine the rule-setting power in which sugarcane ethanol companies engage, and then discuss why these companies develop and use institutions to promote sustainability. We use a machine learning algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation, to identify companies' commitment to sustainability and business-led governance by analyzing a large volume of data from public corporate documents. The results reveal 36 main themes that demonstrate the rule-setting power of the sugarcane ethanol industry through voluntary standards, codes of conduct, and corporate social responsibility these companies use as indicators of superior social and environmental performance and to show sustainability is embedded in companies' priorities. However, the results also show critical issues of unsustainable production practices can affect industry image and stress socio-environmental relationships. These issues can be ameliorated with integrative governance that considers the independence of the sectors involved in ethanol production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For example, in these cases, a child can have cerebral palsy and hearing loss concomitantly. Working with children with multiple disabilities constitutes a challenge, given that they present affectation in several development areas. For these reasons, we have developed a system to support the educational and therapeutic intervention for children with multiple disabilities. Our system relies on an electronic device and an ontology that models some of the most relevant entities and relations of therapy sessions. This proposal has been validated in two stages: (i) a preliminary validation (aesthetic and functionality) with 37 volunteers (higher education students), and (ii) a validation on a real scenario with 6 children with multiple disabilities during a period of two months. The results show high levels of motivation when children work with the device and positive comments by therapists and educators side.

Commonly, during the first four years of life, children make significant progress in learning the language. However, in some cases, there arise delays or differences in patterns of language acquisition, aspects that constitute warnings of developmental problems. For these reasons, in this paper, we describe an educational platform (Pike-Aprende) aimed at supporting the following aspects: a) planning, monitoring, and intervention activities in children (carried out by teachers and Speech and Language Therapists, SLTs), b) automatic design of therapy/stimulation plans for children, and c) supporting the analysis/discrimination of utterances produced by children during sessions. To this aim, we developed a set of tools for web and mobile devices, an expert system for recommending exercises and activities (based on the patient's profile). With the aim of determining the real feasibility of our proposal, we validated the platform with the support of experts in the initial education program. The experts used the system while developed therapy and stimulation sessions with children. The results show significant progress in several participants (in comparison to traditional therapy).

A Volatility Index for Bilateral Electricity Contracting Auctions	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						ARIMA; Electricity auctions; Metaheuristics; MIBEL; Time Series		The use of electricity auctions in daily and intraday trading is one of the most common means of trading on electricity exchanges. Auctions are carried out aiming to reach a marginal price that will be charged for all agents involved. The identification of appropriate moments for placing bids interests consumers and generators, as negotiated demand is directly related to the marginal price established at the end of each auction. In the stock market several indexes assist investors in decision making on operations. However, energy auctions still lack this type of tool. In this context, this paper presents an index proposal based on aggregate supply and demand curves. Machine learning models and time series statistics are employed to predict bid value volatility trends. The experiments used real data from a 958 bid auction promoted by the Iberian Energy Market Operator (Operador del Mercado Iberico de Energia, OMIE), the stock exchange responsible for the spot market in Spain and Portugal. Based on the results, it was possible to identify moments in which the parties involved in the auction chose to compromise on bid values with specification of the magnitude of these concessions.

This paper assesses the current visual appearance of landscapes and implicit land use in ejidal lands on the periphery of Guadalajara, Mexico, using Google Street View (GSV) images tagged for signs of urban distress. Distressed landscapes are associated with the temporal process of urban expansion-newer settlements tend to be more visibly impoverished. Concentrations of vulnerable housing are correlated with encroached-upon ejidal lands in a process that was underway by the 1970s, well before Mexico's neoliberal turn. Ejidos on the urban periphery, created to support agricultural communities during Mexico's radical period of agrarian reform, are now sites of urban sprawl and impoverishment. Nevertheless, these communities remain legally salient as federal entities with respect to the disposition of land. Their presence complicates the historical evolution of land use in the urban periphery in ways that do not fit into classical central place models. We conclude that the presence of ejidos is associated with rapid and chaotic urbanization by migrants and the loss of agricultural capacity in Guadalajara's periphery.

If the consumption pattern of each of these devices is identified, then the management will be more efficient, reducing both the billing and the CO2 emissions. This paper proposes a model for the recognition of energy consumption patterns in household appliances, based on the capture of electrical parameters in connected appliances, through Smart Socket with an Intrusive Load Monitoring approach. The data acquisition system corresponds to an-Internet of Things (IoT) platform that uses Automatic Meter Reading devices, connected to a IoT-gateway via Wi-Fi to send data to an application on the web. For the recognition of the patterns, machine learning techniques are used. Accuracy results on pattern identification are obtained about 91% after applying a backpropagation method in an Artificial Neural Network in time basis. Through this work, the prediction of consumer categories in household appliances, with high levels of reliability and under multiple operating states, is reached.

Yet, most FC studies are blind to non-linear brain dynamics. To circumvent this limitation, we developed a "weighted Symbolic Dependence Metric" (wSDM) measure. Using symbolic transforms, we factor in local and global temporal features of the BOLD signal to weigh a robust copula-based dependence measure by symbolic similarity, capturing both linear and non-linear associations. We compared this measure with a linear connectivity metric (Pearson's R) in its capacity to identify patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and controls based on resting-state data. We recruited participants from two international centers with different MRI recordings to assess the consistency of our measure across heterogeneous conditions. First, a seed-analysis comparison of the salience network (a specific target of bvFTD) and the default-mode network (as a complementary control) between patients and controls showed that wSDM yields better identification of resting-state networks. Moreover, machine learning analysis revealed that wSDM yielded higher classification accuracy. These results were consistent across centers, highlighting their robustness despite heterogeneous conditions. Our findings underscore the potential of wSDM to assess fMRI-derived FC data, and to identify sensitive biomarkers in bvFTD.

Towards the Categorization of Brazilian Financial Market Headlines	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Portals; Social networking (online); Blogs; Crawlers; Electronic mail; Standards; Natural language processing; Machine Learning; Text Categorization; Financial Market		Financial market news portals are valuable sources of information as they hold great power over investors' decision-making processes. Due to the vast amount of text data produced by news portals, several studies have been conducted to comprehend the behavioral variations of texts and automate the categorization of short texts. However, extracting useful information that influences investors' decision-making process is not a trivial task, given that news portals use a heterogeneous and specific language for each content produced, making it challenging to generate a standard document format. This work proposes GOOSE, a solution for the cateGOrizatiOn of Short texts derived from multiple sources of information, to portray the financial market's current situation. To this end, GOOSE is based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and GloVe Embeddings to increase reliability in the short texts classification process. That way, GOOSE obtains data from news portals, which, once combined with a word embedding mechanism, are used as input for the Bi-LSTM to classify financial market news texts. The results obtained showed that GOOSE's efficiency in categorizing texts had an accuracy of 84% but also demonstrated the feasibility of its use in the extraction of information from financial market news portals.

J	Bollis, E; Maia, H; Pedrini, H; Avila, S				Bollis, Edson; Maia, Helena; Pedrini, Helio; Avila, Sandra			Weakly supervised attention-based models using activation maps for citrus mite and insect pest classification	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Weakly supervised learning; Attention; Activation maps; Multiple instance learning; Insect pests		Citrus juices and fruits are commodities with great economic potential in the international market, but productivity losses caused by mites and other pests are still far from being a good mark. Despite the integrated pest mechanical aspect, only a few works on automatic classification have handled images with orange mite characteristics, which means tiny and noisy regions of interest. Attention-based models have gained prominence in deep learning research, and, along with weakly supervised learning algorithms, they have improved tasks performed with some label restrictions. In this context, this work proposes an attention-based activation map approach developed to improve the classification of tiny regions called Two-Weighted Activation Mapping, which also produces locations using feature map scores learned from class labels. We apply our method in a two stage network process called Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning Guided by Saliency Maps. We analyze the proposed approach in two challenging datasets, the Citrus Pest Benchmark, captured directly in the field using magnifying glasses, and the Insect Pest, a large pest image benchmark. We evaluate and compare our models with weakly supervised methods, such as Attention-based Deep MIL and WILDCAT. The results show that our classifier is superior to literature methods, surpassing them in all scenarios by at least 16 percentage points. Moreover, our approach infers bounding box locations for salient insects, even training without location labels.

We present an original solution in order to achieve the main goals of accuracy, flexibility and readability. We propose the SM2D modular data driven approach that provides predictive models for each sub-process of a global hydrological process. We show that this solution improves the predictive accuracy regarding a global approach. The originality of our proposition is threefold: (1) the predictive model is defined as a set of aggregate variables that act as classifiers, (2) an evolutionary technique is implemented to find best juries of such classifiers and (3) the flood process complexity problem is addressed by searching for sub-models on sub-processes identified partly by spatial criteria. The solution has proved to perform well on flash flood phenomena of tropical areas known to be hardly predictable. It was indeed successfully applied on a real caribbean river dataset after both preprocessing and preliminary analysis steps presented in the paper.

On-line recognition of emotions via electroencephalography	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Brain modeling; Electroencephalography; Emotion recognition; Real-time systems; Support vector machines; Filtering; Face recognition; Emotion Recognition; Brain-Computer Interface; Electroencephalography; On-line Processing	EEG	Automated pattern recognition of brain signals can bring about new experiences, enhancing applications in a wide array of areas. One of its fields of study is the recognition of emotions via electroencephalography (EEG), which shows exclusive advantages compared to other methods. However, research with brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is usually structured in two sequential stages: data collection and data analysis. These stages leave a gap in the perspective of a functional system in a production environment since the practitioner needs to wait a considerable length of time until they can see the results of the current activity. An on-line classification system of emotions (positive, neutral, and negative) was developed using open resources in this work. Five machine learning models were trained with the SEED IV dataset, which is labeled with different emotions. The models were trained and tested using nested cross-validation and grid search to obtain the best hyperparameters. The algorithm implementation in Python was integrated with the OpenBCI software to capture the EEG signals, process them, and command the simulations. The best average accuracy obtained for a single subject was 76.19%, and the average accuracy for all subjects was 57.07%. The average execution time for signal processing and prediction, combined, was around one millisecond, which demonstrates the potential for applications with real-time characteristics.	[Weiss, K. A.

While electronic contracts allow automated processes to verify their correctness, most agreements in the real world are still encoded in contracts written in natural language, necessitating substantial human revision effort to eliminate possible conflicting statements, especially for long and complex contracts. We demonstrate the ConCon (Contract Conflicts) tool, to automatically read natural language contracts and indicate potential conflicts among their clauses.

J	Brandolt, F; Vargas, F				Brandolt, F.; Vargas, F.			A Light Implementation of a 3D Convolutional Network for Online Gesture Recognition	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						3DCNN; Gesture Recognition; Online Classification		With the advancement of machine learning techniques and the increased accessibility to computing power, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in image classification and, most recently, in video classification. The possibility of gesture recognition from a video source enables a more natural non-contact human-machine interaction, immersion when interacting in virtual reality environments and can even lead to sign language translation in the near future. However, the techniques utilized in video classification are usually computationally expensive, being prohibitive to conventional hardware. This work aims to study and analyze the applicability of continuous online gesture recognition techniques for embedded systems. This goal is achieved by proposing a new model based on 2D and 3D CNNs able to perform online gesture recognition, i.e. yielding a label while the video frames are still being processed, in a predictive manner, before having access to future frames of the video. This technique is of paramount interest to applications in which the video is being acquired concomitantly to the classification process and the issuing of the labels has a strict deadline. The proposed model was tested against three representative gesture datasets found in the literature. The obtained results suggest the proposed technique improves the state-of-the-art by yielding a quick gesture recognition process while presenting a high accuracy, which is fundamental for the applicability of embedded systems.

Method Applied To Animal MonitoringThrough VANT Images	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Animals; Monitoring; Image resolution; Agriculture; Machine learning; Convolutional neural networks; Graphics processing units; cattle herding; convolutional neural network; deep learning		One of the necessary demands in extensive livestock systems is the counting of animals in areas of tens of hectares, costly when carried out manually and locally. In this context, this work proposes and discusses the efficacy of a semi-autonomous, non-invasive method for remote identification of animals in the field, applicable to precision livestock systems. The method was conceived from an exploratory research methodology based on remote sensing techniques that include image collection processes by aerial surveying with RGB camera embedded in unmanned aerial vehicle, persistence of images obtained by means of storage in space-time databases and processing of stored images for the construction of a rural property orthomosaic succeeded by the application of patterns discovery processes, making use of deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks. According to the experiments carried out, the method was effective, being able to identify and count animals from the collection of images made at 100 m height, with an accuracy of up to 95%, including the approximate geographical position of the animals to field.

There are several strategies to tackle multi-target prediction problems: the local strategy learns a separate model for each target variable independently, while the global strategy learns a single model for all target variables together. Previous studies suggested that the global strategy should be preferred because (1) learning is more efficient, (2) the learned models are more compact, and (3) it overfits much less than the local strategy, as it is harder to overfit on several targets at the same time than on one target. However, it is not clear whether the global strategy exploits correlations between the targets optimally. In this paper, we investigate whether better results can be obtained by learning multiple multi-target models on several partitions of the targets. To answer this question, we first determined alternative partitions using an exhaustive search strategy and a strategy based on a genetic algorithm, and then compared the results of the global and local strategies against these. We used decision trees and random forests as base models.

Wide acceptance has been delayed because of the limitations in accuracy, speed, automation and generalization of these methods. This work introduces a novel technique, the Automated Canopy Estimator (ACE) that overcomes many of these challenges to produce accurate estimates of fractional vegetation cover using an unsupervised segmentation process. ACE is shown to outperform nine other segmentation algorithms, consisting of both threshold-based and machine learning approaches, in the segmentation of photographs of four different crops (oat, corn, rapeseed and flax) with an overall accuracy of 89.6%. ACE is similarly accurate (88.7%) when applied to remotely sensed corn, producing FVC estimates that are strongly correlated with ground truth values.

Non-Stationary Demand Forecasting Based on Empirical Mode Decomposition and Support Vector Machines	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Demand Forecasting; Non-Stationary Time Series; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Support Vector Machines		A company performance strongly depends on its ability of delivering the right quantity of of a given product at the time customers require. Even though some demand forecasting techniques have been developed, they have commonly used simplifying assumptions that limit their use like assuming that the relation between the inputs and the output is linear, for example. Therefore, machine-learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), arise as a promising alternative for accomplishing demand forecasting. SVM has the advantage of performing well in cases where the relationship between input and output data is unknown, and thus has brought good results when applied in different contexts. However, SVM presents some limitations in predicting non-stationary series. In this context, a method called Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) has been adopted for decomposing non-stationary and nonlinear time series into a group of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Moreover, SVM performance strongly depends on the values of real-valued parameters, which need to be tuned to enhance the predictive ability of the model. This situation gives rise to the model selection problem, which may be solved by heuristics such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Therefore, this work proposes a non-stationary demand forecasting methodology based on EMD-PSOSVM. An example in the context of the food industry is presented and we compare the results obtained by the proposed methodology against the ones returned from a plain PSO-SVM. The results show that the proposed EMD-PSO-SVM presented superior performance.	[da Silva, I. D.; Moura, M. C.; Lins, I.

A.; Peedell, Stephen; Szantoi, Zoltan			High-resolution global map of smallholder and industrial closed-canopy oil palm plantations	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							DATA AUGMENTATION	Oil seed crops, especially oil palm, are among the most rapidly expanding agricultural land uses, and their expansion is known to cause significant environmental damage. Accordingly, these crops often feature in public and policy debates which are hampered or biased by a lack of accurate information on environmental impacts. In particular, the lack of accurate global crop maps remains a concern. Recent advances in deep-learning and remotely sensed data access make it possible to address this gap. We present a map of closed-canopy oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations by typology (industrial versus smallholder plantations) at the global scale and with unprecedented detail (10m resolution) for the year 2019. The DeepLabv3+ model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation, was trained to classify Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images onto an oil palm land cover map. The characteristic backscatter response of closed-canopy oil palm stands in Sentinel-1 and the ability of CNN to learn spatial patterns, such as the harvest road networks, allowed the distinction between industrial and smallholder plantations globally (overall accuracy = 98.52 +/- 0.20%), outperforming the accuracy of existing regional oil palm datasets that used conventional machine-learning algorithms. The user's accuracy, reflecting commission error, in industrial and smallholders was 88.22 +/- 2.73% and 76.56 +/- 4.53%, and the producer's accuracy, reflecting omission error, was 75.78 +/- 3.55% and 86.92 +/- 5.12 %, respectively. The global oil palm layer reveals that closed-canopy oil palm plantations are found in 49 countries, covering a mapped area of 19.60 Mha; the area estimate was 21.00 +/- 0.42 Mha (72.7% industrial and 27.3% smallholder plantations). Southeast Asia ranks as the main producing region with an oil palm area estimate of 18.69 +/- 0.33 Mha or 89% of global closed-canopy plantations. Our analysis confirms significant regional variation in the ratio of industrial versus smallholder growers, but it also confirms that, from a typical land development perspective, large areas of legally defined smallholder oil palm resemble industrial-scale plantings. Since our study identified only closed-canopy oil palm stands, our area estimate was lower than the harvested area reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), particularly in West Africa, due to the omission of young and sparse oil palm stands, oil palm in nonhomogeneous settings, and semi-wild oil palm plantations. An accurate global map of planted oil palm can help to shape the ongoing debate about the environmental impacts of oil seed crop expansion, especially if other crops can be mapped to the same level of accuracy. As our model can be regularly rerun as new images become available, it can be used to monitor the expansion of the crop in monocultural settings. The global oil palm layer for the second half of 2019 at a spatial resolution of 10m can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4473715 (Descals et al., 2021).

J	Altuve, M; Hernandez, F				Altuve, Miguel; Hernandez, Fabio			Multiclass Classification of Cardiac Rhythms on Short Single Lead ECG Recordings using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Electrocardiography; Heart beat; RNA; Irrigation; IEEE transactions; Cardiology; Time series analysis; cardiac rythm; Atrial Fibrillation; Electrocardiography; Deep Learning	ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION	The recognition of cardiac rhythms is a topic of great relevance, particularly using short single-lead ECG recordings, due to its potential to early detect cardiovascular diseases and take actions quickly to preserve peoples wellbeing. Among cardiac arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, with significant mortality and morbidity rates. Several approaches have been conceived to identify cardiac rhythms, from the comparison of heart rate with adaptive and fixed thresholds to the application of deep and machine learning techniques. In this work, the classification of three cardiac rhythms (normal, atrial fibrillation, and other arrhythmias), as well as the identification of noise recordings, were performed using bidirectional LSTM networks that exploit the ECG signal (a representation of the cardiac electric activity) and time series containing information about the auricular and ventricular activities. A Monte Carlo 10-fold cross-validation of 10 iterations was performed to assure the generalization of the classifiers and the replicability of the results. An average accuracy of 77.97% was obtained to recognize the four classes but increase up to 85.95% when noise recordings were left out of the classification process. Moreover, micro F1 scores of 89.96%, 79.23%, and 79.77% were obtained for normal rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and other arrhythmias, respectively. The imbalance of classes and the characteristic patterns of normal rhythm and atrial fibrillation were the main factors associated with these performances.

In terms of 5G network management, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) are expected to control and manage network resources. Network Softwarization provides better management of network traffic. However, it does not guarantee network performance will not degradation when the traffic rises. Flow identification has been raised as a solution for keeping the network performance, and it has become a hot topic in both, academy and industry. In particular, there is a high interest in identifying video streaming flows since thanks to 5G and its benefits that improve the streaming media industry, the video streaming traffic is expected to increase dramatically due to the massive connection of 5G compatible devices. Motivated by this, we presented a novel approach for identifying video streaming services. Our approach includes three modules: video stream acquisition module, video stream analyzer module, and application module. In the video stream acquisition module, we capture video streaming packets and organize them into flow records. In the video streaming analyzer module, we analyze the flow records using supervised machine learning algorithms to find the appropriate algorithm that performs better. In the application module, we provide a brief explanation of the applications of our approach. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the overall workload generated by our approach. The results of the evaluation by module corroborate the usefulness and feasibility of our approach for identifying video streaming services.

This is especially true for the continent's hyperarid, arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid zones, collectively known as drylands, which are under-represented ecosystems that are highly threatened by climate change and human activity. Maps of LULC in drylands are, thus, essential in order to investigate their vulnerability to both natural and anthropogenic impacts. This paper comprehensively reviewed existing mapping initiatives of South America's drylands to discuss the main knowledge gaps, as well as central methodological trends and challenges, for advancing our understanding of LULC dynamics in these fragile ecosystems. Our review centered on five essential aspects of remote-sensing-based LULC mapping: scale, datasets, classification techniques, number of classes (legends), and validation protocols. The results indicated that the Landsat sensor dataset was the most frequently used, followed by AVHRR and MODIS, and no studies used recently available high-resolution satellite sensors. Machine learning algorithms emerged as a broadly employed methodology for land cover classification in South America. Still, such advancement in classification methods did not yet reflect in the upsurge of detailed mapping of dryland vegetation types and functional groups. Among the 23 mapping initiatives, the number of LULC classes in their respective legends varied from 6 to 39, with 1 to 14 classes representing drylands. Validation protocols included fieldwork and automatic processes with sampling strategies ranging from solely random to stratified approaches. Finally, we discussed the opportunities and challenges for advancing research on desertification, climate change, fire mapping, and the resilience of dryland populations. By and large, multi-level studies for dryland vegetation mapping are still lacking.

Anomaly-Based Network Intrusion Detection System	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Anomaly; Bloom Filter; IDS; Intrusion Detection System; Malware; N-Gram; NIDS; Payload; Preprocessor; Network Intrusion Detection System; Snort		This paper presents a system for detecting intrusions when analyzing the network traffic payload looking for malware evidences. The system implements the detection algorithm as a Snort preprocessor component. Since they work together, a highly effective system against known attacks has been achieved (based on Snort rules) and a highly effective system against unknown threats (which was the main aim of the designed system). As the majority of such systems, the proposal consists of two phases: a training phase and a detection phase. During the training phase a statistical model of the legitimate network usage is created through Bloom Filters and N-grams techniques. Subsequently, the results obtained by analyzing a dataset of attacks are compared with such model. This will allow a set of rules to be developed which will be able to determine whether the packets payloads contain malware. In the detection phase, the traffic to analyze is compared with the model created in the training phase and the results obtained when applying rules. The performed experiments showed really satisfactory results, with 100% malware detection and just 0.15% false positives.	[Villalba, L. J.

J	Arantes, MD; Toledo, CFM; Williams, BC; Ono, M				Arantes, Marcio da Silva; Motta Toledo, Claudio Fabiano; Williams, Brian Charles; Ono, Masahiro			Collision-Free Encoding for Chance-Constrained Nonconvex Path Planning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS			English	Article						Autonomous agents; chance constraints; mixed-integer linear programming (MILP); optimization under uncertainty; probabilistic planning	UNCERTAINTY; SAFE	The path planning methods based on nonconvex constrained optimization, such as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), have found various important applications, ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to space vehicles. Moreover, their stochastic extensions have enabled risk-aware path planning, which explicitly limits the probability of failure to a user-specified bound. However, a major challenge of those path planning methods is constraint violation between discrete time steps. In the existing approach, a path is represented by a sequence of waypoints and the safety constraints (e.g., obstacle avoidance) are imposed on waypoints. Therefore, the trajectory between waypoints could violate the safety constraints. A naive continuous-time extension results in unrealistic computation cost. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to ensure constraint satisfaction between waypoints without employing a continuous-time formulation. The key idea is to enforce that the same inequality constraint is satisfied on any two adjacent time steps, under assumptions of polygonal obstacles and straight line trajectory between waypoints. The resulting problem encoding is MILP, which can be solved efficiently by commercial solvers. Thus, we also introduce novel extensions to risk-allocation path planners with improved scalability for real-world scenarios and run-time performance. While the proposed encoding approach is general, the particular emphasis of this paper is placed on the chance-constrained, nonconvex path-planning problem (CNPP). We provide extensive simulation results on CNPP to demonstrate the path safety and scalability of our encoding and related path planners.

Pruning Method in The Architecture of Extreme Learning Machines Based on Partial Least Squares Regression	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Extreme Learning Machine; Pattern Classification; Pruning Methods; Partial least squares regression		The extreme learning machines-ELM are useful models for performing classification and regression of data, as well as being an alternative methodology to techniques that use back-propagation to determine values of parameters used in hidden layers of the learning model. A problem that ELM may face when performing data mining techniques is to become a very generalist model with no accurate or time-consuming processing due to a high number of neurons in the hidden layers of its architecture, if a model very restricted the characteristics of the sample that was used for the training, losing its generalization capacity, As the number of neurons in the hidden layer increases, information unnecessary to the model can be included in the operations performed by the model, impairing the accuracy end of the ELM when sorting or performing regression data. To solve this problem, a pruning method based on partial least squares regression was proposed to act together with the neurons of the hidden layer of an ELM. By obtaining a ranking vector with regression values and between variables in the hidden layer of ELM, the selection of the neurons that have the best predictive capacity in the responses between the data is used. Data classification tests were performed using bases commonly used in work related to machine learning and compared to other classifier models. Lastly, it is verified that an ELM with fewer neurons in the hidden layer, where the selected neurons are the ones that contribute better to the classification of the model, improve the final accuracy of the model in comparison to an architecture with a much larger number of neurons and is statistically similar to other pruning methods of the neurons in the inner layer of the ELM, allowing gain of model performance without damaging the accuracy in the final results, without losing its ability to perform classification tasks correctly.

In addition, offshore software development projects are becoming increasingly common. The added physical distance between collaborating teams compounds communication challenges that have been identified as one of the most important risk factors in Software Development Projects. Special training, tools, methodologies and work-habits are necessary for members of distributed teams. In this paper we describe how this training can be accomplished in the classroom by describing the experiences gained in the Software Engineering II Master Degree Course at Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico. A practical off-shoring software development project was executed and is described and the student learning experience is evaluated.

Huis in 't			Blood donation among individuals of African origin in the Netherlands: how are barriers and motivators associated with intention?	BLOOD TRANSFUSION			English	Article						blood donation; barriers; motivators; intention; Africans	DONORS; MIGRANTS; MINORITY	Background - Blood donors of African origin are under-represented in high-income Western countries, white their extended blood types closely match chronic transfusion patients with similar ancestral backgrounds. To prevent alloimunisation, it is important to recruit and retain more African blood donors. The aim of this study was to gain insight into blood donation barriers and motivators of individuals of African origin, and to assess how these are associated with the intention to donate blood. Materials and methods - An online survey sample included 300 participants of sub-Saharan African, Afro-Surinamese and Afro-Caribbean origin living in the Netherlands. They ranked 25 barriers and 19 motivators on the level of impediment and facilitation in blood donation. We compared differences in barriers and motivators between ever- and never-donors and tested associations with the intention to donate blood using univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses, adjusted for gender, age, ethnicity, immigrant generation, educational level, and blood donation history. Results - Receiving information about the donation procedure was a highly ranked motivator especially among never-donors (50%) and was positively associated with the intention to donate (p<0.05). Non-monetary incentives, convenience factors and awareness were other important motivators. Highly ranked barriers related to fears and not feeling healthy enough to donate, althought only "believing donation is scary or stressful" (reported by 8% of the ever-donors and 25% of the never-donors) remained significantly associated with intention to donate in the multivariate model (p<0.05). Recipient preferences, religion and distrust were less often reported and were not associated with donation intention. Discussion - The highest ranked barriers and motivators were not necessarily the best predictors of donation intention. These findings have valuable implications for future interventions focussing on individuals of African origin.	[Klinkenberg, Elisabeth F.; de Kort, Wim L. A. M.; Veld, Elisabeth M. J.

In most of them, the network is composed of a significant number of nodes deployed in an extensive area in which not all nodes are directly connected. Then, the data exchange is supported by multihop communications. Routing protocols are in charge of discovering and maintaining the routes in the network. However, the appropriateness of a particular routing protocol mainly depends on the capabilities of the nodes and on the application requirements.

Quantitative Criteria for Alert Correlation of Anomaly-based NIDS	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Alert Correlation; Anomalies; False Positives; IDS; Intrusion Detection System; Network-based Intrusion Detection System; NIDS	ATTACK SCENARIOS; MODEL	This paper presents an alert correlation system for mitigating the false positives problem on network-based intrusion detection, when anomalous detection techniques are applied. The system allows the quantitative assessment of the likelihood that an alert issued because an anomaly becomes a real threat. To do this the differences between the characteristics of the model representing the habitual and legitimate network usage are taken into account, as well as the most representative features of the traffic that generated the alert. The result is a quantitative assessment of its similarity to the network legitimate usage, and the prioritization of the issued alerts. Experiments have demonstrated the validity of the proposal. The 95.7% of the false positives were labeled as low priority treatment alerts, and the various real threats were properly identified.	[Vidal, J. M.; Orozco, A. L.

MILKDE: A new approach for multiple instance learning based on positive instance selection and kernel density estimation	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Multiple instance learning; KDE; Instance selection; Instance ranking	CLASSIFICATION	Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a recent paradigm of learning, which is based on the assignment of a single label to a set of instances called bag. A bag is positive if it contains at least one positive instance, and negative otherwise. This work proposes a new algorithm based on likelihood computation by means of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) called MILKDE. Using the LogitBoost classifier, its performance was compared to that of forty-three MIL algorithms available in the literature using five data sets. Our proposal outperformed all of them for the Elephant (87.40%), Fox (66.80%) and COREL 2000 data sets (77.8%), and achieved competitive results for the MUSK 1 (89.20%) and MUSK 2 (87.50%) data sets, which are comparable to the higher accuracies obtained by other methods for this data sets. Overall results are statistically comparable to those obtained by the most well known methods for MIL described in the literature.	[Faria, A. W. C.; Coelho, F. G. F.; Rocha, H. P.; Lemos, A.

Design And Implementation Of A Low-Cost Universal Control For Intelligent Electric Wheelchairs	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Intelligent; low cost; Universal Control Device; Wheelchair		Electric wheelchairs are a fundamental tool for millions of people all over the world. Thanks to this type of wheelchairs persons who suffer from reduced mobility can go about their normal lives. Numerous research works had been carried out with the aim of improving the quality of life of people who are bound to a wheelchair, focusing on the creation of novel control interfaces. Through these interfaces, wheelchair users can have control of it using their voice, simple gestures or eye movement. However, if we look objectively at these interfaces, they are all developed on the basis of a different control system, making it difficult to embed these solutions in real environments. Currently, there is no universal control device which would act as a link between the user's wheelchair and the developed control interfaces. In this work, we propose the design of a low-cost, universal control board for the control of the wheelchairs' trajectory, so that any systems integrator of control interface can use it for both research and the development of prototypes that will improve the quality of life in our society.

The architecture relies on a novel meta-model that abstracts the laboratory ambient using a context model, an adaptation model, an end-user model, and a domain model. Thus, the architecture offers, to the end-users, a set of adaptive AmI services that are supplied by smart agents and wireless sensor networks. The architecture was coded using SQLite, Jade, Protege, and CLIPs and simulated under Oracle's Solarium environment. The latency and scalability of the proposed architecture, as well as its ability to supply effectively the AmI services, were tested using both qualitative and quantitative standard performance metrics.

Extending knowledge based redundancy in association rules with imprecise knowledge	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Imprecise Association Rule Mining; Certainty Factor Model; Dempster-Schaffer Theory; Knowledge guided post-processing; Redundant Rules		Association Rules Mining is one of the most studied and widely applied fields in Data Mining. However, the discovery models usually result in a very large set of rules; so the analysis capability, from the user point of view, is diminishing. Hence, it is difficult to use the found model in order to assist decision-making process. The previous handicap is heightened in presence of redundant rules in the final set. In this work we study a way to eliminate redundancy in association rules with uncertainty, with imprecise user prior knowledge. A post-processing method is developed to eliminate this kind of redundancy, using association rules known by the user. Our proposal allows to find more compact models of association rules to ease its use in the decision-making process. The developed experiments have shown that the reduction using certainty factor has a slightly better behavior.

Multiple efforts have been done to define the User Interface. Here, it is combined a neutral description of the UI with a semantic recovery of information. The focus of this paper is the generation of the containment structure based on the context of the application. The process includes three main tasks: first a fixed division of the neutral definition of the UI (a task tree), Then heuristic rules based on the vicinity are applied and finally a set of container patterns is provided to polish the UI. Alternative configurations are delivered and weighted. Since multiple metrics has been proposed a comparison of them was delivered. The results of the comparative analysis suggest that some metrics, although more sophisticated and fine-grained, do not necessarily improve significantly the quality of determining user interface containers, therefore stemming for simple, yet efficient, metrics used to reach a threshold. Finally, a set of plausible UIs is delivered.

Genome-wide diversity of Zika virus: Exploring spatio-temporal dynamics to guide a new nomenclature proposal	VIRUS EVOLUTION			English	Article						Zika virus; arbovirus; phylogeography; molecular epidemiology; evolutionary biology	MOSAIC STRUCTURE; DNA-SEQUENCES; RECOMBINATION; EVOLUTION; ENHANCEMENT; POPULATIONS; EMERGENCE; SELECTION; CRITERIA; EPIDEMIC	The Zika virus (ZIKV) disease caused a public health emergency of international concern that started in February 2016. The overall number of ZIKV-related cases increased until November 2016, after which it declined sharply. While the evaluation of the potential risk and impact of future arbovirus epidemics remains challenging, intensified surveillance efforts along with a scale-up of ZIKV whole-genome sequencing provide an opportunity to understand the patterns of genetic diversity, evolution, and spread of ZIKV. However, a classification system that reflects the true extent of ZIKV genetic variation is lacking. Our objective was to characterize ZIKV genetic diversity and phylodynamics, identify genomic footprints of differentiation patterns, and propose a dynamic classification system that reflects its divergence levels. We analysed a curated dataset of 762 publicly available sequences spanning the full-length coding region of ZIKV from across its geographical span and collected between 1947 and 2021. The definition of genetic groups was based on comprehensive evolutionary dynamics analyses, which included recombination and phylogenetic analyses, within- and between-group pairwise genetic distances comparison, detection of selective pressure, and clustering analyses. Evidence for potential recombination events was detected in a few sequences. However, we argue that these events are likely due to sequencing errors as proposed in previous studies. There was evidence of strong purifying selection, widespread across the genome, as also detected for other arboviruses. A total of 50 sites showed evidence of positive selection, and for a few of these sites, there was amino acid (AA) differentiation between genetic clusters. Two main genetic clusters were defined, ZA and ZB, which correspond to the already characterized 'African' and 'Asian' genotypes, respectively. Within ZB, two subgroups, ZB.1 and ZB.2, represent the Asiatic and the American (and Oceania) lineages, respectively. ZB.1 is further subdivided into ZB.1.0 (a basal Malaysia sequence sampled in the 1960s and a recent Indian sequence), ZB.1.1 (South-Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, and Micronesia sequences), and ZB.1.2 (very similar sequences from the outbreak in Singapore). ZB.2 is subdivided into ZB.2.0 (basal American sequences and the sequences from French Polynesia, the putative origin of South America introduction), ZB.2.1 (Central America), and ZB.2.2 (Caribbean and North America). This classification system does not use geographical references and is flexible to accommodate potential future lineages. It will be a helpful tool for studies that involve analyses of ZIKV genomic variation and its association with pathogenicity and serve as a starting point for the public health surveillance and response to on-going and future epidemics and to outbreaks that lead to the emergence of new variants.

The main challenge is the difference between research projects and scientific literature. Research projects are a collection of information in different formats and available in different places. Even projects from the same funding call follow a different structure in most of the cases, despite there were some requirements that they should meet at the end of the funding period. Furthermore, the sources in which the scientific literature is available provide metadata and powerful search tools, meanwhile most of the research projects are not stored in public and accessible databases, or the databases usually do not provide enough information and tools to conduct a systematic search. For this reason, this work provides the guidelines to support systematics reviews of research projects following the method called Systematic Research Projects Review (SRPR). This methodology is based on the Kitchenham's adaptation of the systematic literature review.

In these cases, when the model is learning from data, there is not an extra quantity of noiseless data available and computational resources are unlimited. In practice, it is necessary to deal with finite noisy datasets, which lead to uncertainty about what so appropriate the model is. For this, the employment of models based on Bayesian inference are preferable. Then, probabilities are treated as a way to represent the subjective uncertainty from rational agent, performing an approximated inference by maximizing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. A modified algorithm using long-short memory recurrent neural networks for time series forecasting was presented. This new approach was chosen in order to be as close as possible to the original series in the sense of minimizing the associated Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate and illustrate results, comparing this approach with Bayesian neural-networks-based algorithms for artificial chaotic time-series.

Investing in Late-Life Brain Capital	INNOVATION IN AGING			English	Article						Aging; Brain health; Innovation; Mental disorders; Neuroscience; Psychiatry		Within many societies and cultures around the world, older adults are too often undervalued and underappreciated. This exacerbates many key challenges that older adults may face. It also undermines the many positive aspects of late life that are of tremendous value at both an individual and societal level. We propose a new approach to elevate health and well-being in late life by optimizing late-life Brain Capital. This form of capital prioritizes brain skills and brain health in a brain economy, which the challenges and opportunities of the 21st-century demands. This approach incorporates investing in late-life Brain Capital, developing initiatives focused on building late-life Brain Capital.
